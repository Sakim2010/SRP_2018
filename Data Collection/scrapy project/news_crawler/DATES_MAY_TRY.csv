"May 01, 2018","ON Saturday evening, Michelle Wolf, a comedian who broke into the business on late-night television and The Daily Show, scandalised a village inhabited by politicians, lobbyists and reporters by … wait for it … being a comedian.,Wolf, the latest professional wit invited to entertain those gathered at the annual White House Correspondents’ Association dinner by roasting the president, the media and the rest of the Washington establishment, cracked wise, funny, ruthless, cruel and vulgar jokes for 19 minutes about subjects near and dear to those stakeholders.,She took on topics like the White House assault on facts; how women’s issues, political spin, and dissembling intersect uncomfortably with luminaries such as Ivanka Trump, Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders; President Donald Trump’s possible dalliance with a porn star, his wealth and his courtship of white nationalists; Ted Kennedy and Chappaquiddick; Al Franken and sexual harassment; Democratic ineptitude; and the tangled, symbiotic relationship between journalists and the president.,“And just a reminder to everyone, I’m here to make jokes,” Wolf said at the top of her routine. “I have no agenda. I’m not trying to get anything accomplished. So everyone that’s here from Congress, you should feel right at home.”,Lots of the dinner guests, we now know, did not end up feeling right at home as Wolf toed the line between being provocative and being offensive — a line that comedy, particularly political comedy, routinely blurs. Many of the critical responses to Wolf’s caustic monologue wound up showing the extent to which the joke here truly is on tribal, insular Washington itself, and why cosy media events like Saturday’s dinner are inevitably uncomfortable and better off put to rest.,A tour around some of the reactions to Wolf — whom journalists invited to the dinner to exercise her own ribald form of free speech — also throws some Trump-era hypocrisies into relief.,Dennis Miller, a conservative political comedian and Saturday Night Live veteran, seemed to forget that he’s an occasionally nasty comedian himself when he took to Twitter over the weekend to slam Wolf. Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, was so put off by Wolf’s routine that he and his wife fled the dinner. Fair enough. But the Schlapps weren’t so insulted that they couldn’t continue to partake in the event’s other vaguely swampy festivities. They reportedly showed up at a swanky after-party hosted by NBC at the Art Museum of the Americas.,Journalists — liberal, iconoclastic, free-speaking journalists — also took to Twitter to criticise Wolf or sympathise with her targets, notably Sanders. Perhaps not surprisingly, the president’s press secretary got some of the most rousing support from veterans of the fourth estate, including Andrea Mitchell.,I’m not so sure that Wolf was the “worst” since Don Imus skewered Bill Clinton for his extramarital affairs and Hillary Clinton for her legal problems at a media dinner in Washington back in 1996. Remember Stephen Colbert’s savage roasting of President George W Bush at the Correspondents’ Dinner in 2006? That was pretty brutal (and uncomfortable and funny). How about Seth Meyers teeing up Trump at the 2011 instalment? Tough stuff. And funny. (And maybe the reason Trump hasn’t shown up at the last two dinners.),Sanders is an interesting exhibit in Washington tribalism. She has presided over myriad press conferences in which she has gone out of her way to insult the reporters present, while also accusing the press of “purposefully misleading the American people”. She also regularly goes to bat for a boss who has described the media as the “enemy of the American people”. Some of Sanders’s supporters in the press complained that Wolf made fun of the press secretary’s looks. I thought that Wolf was making fun of the press secretary’s demeanour and character; that’s a distinction with a difference.,In the meantime, it’s worth identifying the real problem with the Correspondents’ Association dinner: journalists enter perilous territory when they take too much pleasure in getting dressed up and going out with the people they write about.,The event is firmly part of a certain nostalgic Washington tradition, one that’s rooted in the idea that there’s a shared faith in the fundamental value of fact-based journalism. But there isn’t. And that’s a fact that can’t be obscured by the kind of bland humour for which Wolf’s critics seem to pine.,So let’s just stop trying.",2018-05-01,https://www.dawn.com/news/1404913/hey-washington-the-jokes-really-on-you,"Hey, Washington, the joke’s really on you

"May 01, 2018","COLOMBO: Sri Lanka is celebrating its most important annual Buddhist festival, Vesak — celebrated on the first full moon in the month of May. Sacred relics from both India and Pakistan, have been sent to the country to be displayed for the devotees of the Buddhist faith. ,Relics of the Buddha brought to Sri Lanka from Sarnath in India and those brought from the Taxila Museum in Pakistan, will be placed at several temples to commemorate the birth, enlightenment and death of the Buddha. ,The relics from Sarnath, India, carried by the General Secretary of the Maha Bodhi Society of Calcutta, Ven. P. Seewali Thera, were received by India’s High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu, and presented to Sri Lanka’s parliament speaker Karu Jayasuriya. ,The relics — brought to Sri Lanka for the first time in more than a century — were enshrined, at Mulagandhakuti Vihara in Sarnath, in Uttar Pradesh India. Sarnath is a place of holy significance for the Buddhist faith, as it was in the village, in a deer park, where Gautama Buddha is said to have delivered his first sermon, giving birth to the Buddhist sangha — the community of monks, who have achieved a significant level of enlightenment. ,Anagarika Dharmapala, the Sri Lankan founder of the Maha Bodhi Society of India, built the Mulagandhakuti Vihara to restore the glory of Sarnath. The relics of the Buddha were presented as gifts to the Maha Bodhi Society by the Government of India. ,The relics sent by Pakis­tan were received by Bud­dha Sasana Minister Gam­ini Jayawickrema Perera and the Pakistan High Commissioner in Sri Lanka, Dr Shahid Hashmat. ,Dr Hashmat said that the artefacts are a priceless part of the archaeological heritage of Pakistan and depict the rich Buddhist tradition of the country. ,The high commission of Pakistan in Sri Lanka, in a statement, said that Pakistan is keen to take part in the celebrations. The various artefacts will be on display, till May 2, at the Temple Trees, the official residence of the Sri Lankan Prime Minister. From May 3 to May 12, the relics will be placed at several temples across the island. ,A casket has been specially designed to secure the two most revered relics from India and Pakistan. The relics, enclosed in the silver casket, enshrined in the Vihara, were excavated by Sir John Marshall in 1913-14, near the ancient city of Taxila, (Takshashila). ,They were found in a small Buddhist chapel close to the Dharmarajika Stupa in a silver reliquary — a container for holy relics — with inscriptions dating back to the year 136 (circa 79AD). The second relic enshrined at Sarnath was found by A. H. Longhurst of the Archaeological Survey of India in 1929 in a large Stupa at Nagarjunakonda in the Guntur District of the then Madras Presidency. The Stupa in which the relic was found is described as the Maha Chetiyaor — the ‘Great Stupa’ of the Blessed One. The relics will be displayed — among other areas — in the districts of Colombo, Matara, Anuradhapura and Kandy. All displays will be open for the public till May 16. ,Buddhism was founded in India, 2600 years ago. It spread across the Indian subcontinent and extended to nearby regions, but lost significance in its birthplace due to the revival of Hindu sects like Shaivism and Vaishnavism. The faith however, thrived in many other regions including far east states like Myanmar, and Thailand. Today, Sri Lanka and Bhutan are the only Buddhist majority countries in the Indian subcontinent.

"May 01, 2018","ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday incr­eased the prices of diesel and petrol by Rs2.31 and Rs1.70 per litre, respectively, for the month of May — almost half of the increase worked out by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra). ,An announcement by the finance ministry said: “The prime minister declined to pass on the full impact of the increase in prices to the consumers and decided that the government will absorb almost 50 per cent of the impact of increase. For this reason, GST on petrol, kerosene and light diesel oil was slightly reduced and that on high speed diesel kept unchanged at 27.5pc.” ,The price of high speed diesel (HSD) was increased by 2.31pc, petrol by 1.98pc, kerosene by 4.45pc and light diesel oil (LDO) by 5.43pc. The ex-depot price of HSD was raised by Rs2.31 to Rs98.76 per litre from Rs96.45 and that of petrol by Rs1.70 to Rs87.70 from Rs86. The price of kerosene was increased by Rs3.41 to Rs79.87 per litre from Rs76.46 and that of LDO by Rs3.55 to Rs68.85 from Rs65.30. ,Ogra had proposed an increase of Rs5.02 per litre in the price of HSD, Rs3.22 in motor gasoline (petrol), Rs6.97 in kerosene and Rs6.95 in LDO. Interestingly, the regulator had calculated the prices on the basis of higher than notified tax rates for HSD on the order of the finance ministry to enable the government to announce a relatively lower rate for political objectives. ,The ministry had ordered calculation of prices on the basis of 31pc GST on HSD and 17pc on all other products. This was despite the fact that the notified-GST rate stood at 27.5pc on HSD, 17pc on kerosene, 16.5pc on LDO and 21.5pc on petrol. ,Under the practice in vogue, oil prices are revised on the last day of every month. ,Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has been allowing a gradual increase in the prices of LDO and kerosene to bridge a price differential with petrol to minimise mixing of the two products. ,Interestingly, kerosene is the only regulated petroleum product but unavailable at the fixed rate anywhere in the country.

"May 01, 2018","THE weather here is pleasant, and it has been raining since morning. Bashir Baloch, the well-known folk singer of the city — he has so far been given 132 awards, including two presidential awards, over his career — sits gloomily at his residence. There is no one else in the room; just him and his awards. ,In his highly conservative area of Killi Deba, situated in the heart of the city, I humbly request him to sing a song of his favourite singer. After some thought, and trying to bring some semblance of a smile on his lips, he agrees to sing one of Lata Mangeshkar’s songs. As he finishes, he tells me: “You know, I came to know about her at the age of 7, and liked her work so much that I started singing her songs at the age of 11.”,In his vicinity, almost everyone knows Bashir Baloch. Had that not been the case, the narrow alleys leading to his impoverished house would be hard to navigate correctly. “I was recently at the Chief Minister House from 11am to 9pm,” he continues. “I was promised a meeting with Chief Minister Abdul Quddus Bizenjo, but unfortunately he was busy the whole day. Finally, I pleaded to be allowed to come back home. He could not take out even five minutes for a meeting with me.”,Gone are the days when Bashir Baloch would, besides other programmes, be regularly invited on , and ,, the state-run TV channel. With the remuneration he received, he supported his family. ,But then, explains Baloch writer Waheed Zaheer, the private TV channel boom occurred after the turn of the millennium, followed by the social media revolution. “Now, there are channels after channels, so who will watch Bashir Baloch on ,, or listen to him on ,?” asks Zaheer. “Times have changed.” ,Bashir Baloch has seven children and his eldest daughter is 16. The family lives hand to mouth. There is someone, he says, by the name of Nisar Shahwani who enrolled his children at a school in Deba, and also sends wheat for his family annually. “Had Nisar not stretched out his hand, I would not have been able to even send my children to school,” the singer says. ,Besides Balochi and Brahui, he sings in six languages; singing is his life. In Balochistan and elsewhere in the country, Bashir Baloch says he has been respected wherever he has gone. People always know him, he says, and several people he has met in recent times have given him money despite the fact that they themselves were hard up. “What I need is some sort of official support from the government, so that I may continue my singing and financially support my family,” he explains. “As a folk singer, I think I should not be asking for financial assistance. But what else I can do? If this doesn’t happen, I will die from hunger along with the children.”,It is said that at the time of the 1965 war between India and Pakistan, singer Madam Noor Jehan boosted the morale of the armed forces, which made her even more popular. “That is what inspired me, too, as a singer,” says Bashir Baloch. “I did sing those songs of hers with a lot of interest, because Pakistan is my motherland.” ,Folk singing is a herculean task. Among thousands, it is said, one folk singer is born. In a stunted society such as ours, they are unfortunately born to suffer endlessly. According to former Balochi Academy chairman Abdul Wahid Bandeeg, all of Balochistan’s folk singers’ story is the same as that of Bashir Baloch. “There is no end to their economic sufferings,” Bandeeg says.,Echoing this claim, Bashir Baloch says he would happily sing, but he has had to finally give up. There are, according to him, some 20 more folk singers in Quetta who are facing the same fate as his, but they are suffering silently. “I am not brave like them,” he says, his eyes brimming with tears. “They suffer, they sing, and they keep silent. I am shamelessly running from pillar to post for some financial assistance.”",2018-05-01,https://www.dawn.com/news/1404844/meet-quettas-beleaguered-folk-singer,"Meet Quetta’s beleaguered folk singer

It was still unclear if such measures could bring permanent peace because no major breakthrough in the North Korean nuclear standoff was produced after ,. ,South Korean soldiers disassembled loudspeakers at multiple front-line areas before pulling them away from the border, according to Seoul's Defence Ministry. A ministry official, speaking anonymously citing department rules, gave no further details such as how long the dismantling work would continue. ,South Korean media reported that Seoul detected signs that North Korea was taking similar steps on Tuesday. But the Defence Ministry says it cannot confirm the report. ,Both Koreas before the summit had halted propaganda broadcasts along the 248-kilometre-long border. ,Cold War-era propaganda warfare had resurfaced in 2016 when tensions rose sharply after the North's fourth nuclear test. Seoul broadcast criticism of the North's abysmal human rights conditions, world news and weather forecasts as well as pop songs. The North broadcast anti-South messages and praises of its own political system. ,North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has suspended nuclear and missile tests and placed his nuclear program up for negotiation, but scepticism lingers about how serious he is and what disarmament steps he would eventually take. ,Some experts say Kim's sincerity would be tested during his planned meeting with President Donald Trump in what would be the first-ever North Korea-US summit talks since the end of their fighting in the 1950-53 Korean War. ,Trump said on Monday he likes the idea of going to the southern side of Panmunjom, the place for the Korean summit, to meet Kim, though he said Singapore was also under consideration. He said on Saturday that his meeting with Kim could happen in the next three to four weeks. ,During Friday's summit, Kim told South Korean President Moon that he would shut down his country's only known nuclear testing site in May and allow outside experts and journalists to watch the process. ,Kim also said he would be willing to give up his nuclear programs if the United States commits to a formal end to the Korean War and a pledge not to attack the North, according to South Korea's presidential office. ,Some experts downplayed the significance of the closing of the Punggy-ri test site, where six underground explosions have been conducted and which the doubters believe may be too unstable for another. Kim denied such views, saying the site has two underground tunnels to be used for new tests. ,During a telephone call with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday, Moon said he wants the UN to observe the work to close down the Punggy-ri site. Moon also asked for the UN to formally declare its support for his recent summit declaration with Kim, and Guterres responded he'll try to contribute for an establishment of peace on the Korean Peninsula, according to Moon's office. ,According to their summit accord, Kim and Moon agreed to achieve “a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula through complete denuclearisation,” rather than clearly stating “a nuclear-free North Korea.” ,North Korea has long said the term “denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula” must include the United States pulling its 28,500 troops out of South Korea and removing its so-called “nuclear umbrella” security commitment to South Korea and Japan. ,Kim could offer more disarmament concessions during his meeting with Trump, and some analysts say Kim may announce scraping North Korea's long-range missile program, which has posed a direct threat to the United States.",2018-05-01,https://www.dawn.com/news/1404997/south-korea-dismantles-propaganda-loudspeakers-at-border,"South Korea dismantles propaganda loudspeakers at border

She also observed that the outgoing government had no legal and moral authority to present a full year budget. ,She chided the government for its non-serious attitude towards parliament as there was not a single minister present when the session began. Of the 104 members of the Senate, only 26 were present in the house, nine of them were on the treasury benches. “Mr Chairman, ask those who talk about the sanctity of the vote where their ministers have gone,” she said, while addressing Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani. ,She slammed the government for presenting what she called a “lame duck budget”. ,PM’s adviser says no justification for imposing financial emergency ,“The future of Pakistan is at risk. This is a lame duck budget by a lame duck government. This is pre-poll rigging,” claimed Ms Rehman. “This is a borrowing, billionaire’s and , (disaster) budget,” she emphasised. ,Commenting on the fall in textile exports, she said Pakistan’s textile industry contributed 57 per cent of the country’s exports, but had lost its global textile share by 23pc. She said that 150 mills had shut down, which was alarming because Pakistan was the fifth largest cotton producer in the world. ,Pointing out lucanae in the proposed budget, Ms Rehman said: “Our circular debt has reached a whopping Rs1 trillion. We are the seventh most stressed water nation and only Rs38bn has been allocated for water without any details.” ,She said the public debt, which was Rs13 trillion during the Pakistan Peoples Party’s (PPP) term had soared to a massive Rs22 trillion. ,“Pakistan’s entire budget is based on borrowing to pay back more loans. How can the government not call this a financial emergency? The next government will face a nightmare of repayment and no revenue stream,” Ms Rehman elaborated. ,She said that 30pc tax concessions had been given to billionaires in the current budget but there was nothing for the poor. The government had provided no relief for the masses, she added, instead the burden remained on the poor. ,“Why has the government given tax concessions on imported LNG and none to Pakistani gas? The Qatar LNG deal is already marred by controversy. To this day, we don’t know what is under the black ink used to block transparency on the contract with Qatar Gas,” she said. ,The Senator pointed out that the NFC award had not been disbursed in five years. “How can they determine where the federal slew of consolidated indirect taxes like the economic fund will go without the NFC award?

The defence ministry now wants this year’s allocation to be compared with the revised figures, instead of the original allocation, because it wants to avoid the sharp rise in defence spending getting public attention. ,“Defence budget for the year 18-19 stands at Rs1,100bn which is 10.2pc increase to the closing year. The routine yearly increase ranges between 10pc and 12pc which caters for inflation, depreciation, rise in pay etc,” the ministry said. ,“This year increase in defence budget is also considered a normal increase, keeping in view all internal and external challenges posed to Pakistan,” it added. ,Journalists usually measure the defence allocations in terms of the percentage increase over previous year. This does not give a correct view. Therefore, defence budgets for a more realistic analysis are measured in terms of percentage of both overall public spending and of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). ,Defence spending share in terms of both total outlay of the budget and percentage of GDP have been going up. Over the past decade or so defence spending was reduced to less than 3pc (around 2.6pc) of GDP and similarly its share in the national pie was also reduced to well under 20pc.

"May 01, 2018","ISLAMABAD: Water shortage is exceeding official estimates amid Tarbela Dam hitting dead level for the second time in a fortnight. The development will be a serious challenge for Kharif crops in Sindh and Balochistan.,Officials said the existing water resource at Tarbela dam was heading towards dead level in two days and there were no immediate signs of improving river flows in the catchment of Northern parts of the country.,They said conservation level at two reservoirs — Tarbela and Mangla — had reached dead level almost a month ago and mostly remained so until mid-April.,They said current storage at Tarbela was around 4-feet that would exhaust within two days at the current rate of discharges of 40,000 cusec compared to 35,000 cusec of inflows. In fact, the discharges were reduced to 40,000 cusec on Monday from previous level of 45,000 cusec because of precarious circumstances.,The officials said the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) had estimated up to 40 per cent water shortage for early-Kharif period which is now being anticipated to go beyond 44pc if river flows do not improve in a day. As a consequence, the provincial inter-provincial bickering is emerging over discharges as provincial irrigation authorities seek greater control over limited resources.,The sources said Punjab on Monday asked the water regulator to reduce discharges from Mangla dam from 28,000 cusec to 25,000 cusec as flows in river Chenab had improved and would be suffice to meet its irrigation requirements. ,However, Irsa rejected the demand fearing it would create serious issues at Chashma barrage and may need closure of Taunsa-Panjnad (TP) Link Canal and hence releases from Mangla could not be reduced at this stage. Instead, the regulator said it was shifting 4200cusec from Taunsa-Panjnad to Jehlum-Chenab zone.,On the other hand, Sindh irrigation department warned that while storage at Tarbela was just 4-feet above 1,386-feet operating level, the storage at Mangla was 53-feet higher than operating level of 1,103-feet. It protested that despite this situation, discharges were still in progress from Tarbela against conservation at Mangla.,“Further transfer of water from Indus to Jhelum-Chenab System through CJ canal and TP Link Canal is being continued” despite the fact that water availability on Indus was on the lower side than Jhelum-Chenab zone,” Sindh government said.,Sindh feared that “acute water shortage crisis in the province will be further aggravated” within 1-2 days if the trend continued, forcing dam operations purely on run-of-the river basis and the Sindh would have no other option “except to defer operation of right bank canals of Guddu and Sukkur barrages, which will obviously affect the supplies to Balochistan canals of Pat Feeder and Kirthar also.,Therefore, Sindh demanded immediate end to transfer of water from Indus to Jhelum-Chenab system and requirements of Trimmu, Panjnad and Sindh canals be fulfilled by releasing more water from Mangla.,Kharif season starts from April 1 to November 30, and rice, sugarcane, cotton and maize are some of the key crops.,According to the latest data released by Irsa on Monday, the Tarbela dam was at 1390-feet against its dead level of 1,386-feet, with inflows of 34,900 cusecs and outflows of 45,000 cusecs. ,The Water level at the Mangla dam stood at 1,103-feet against its dead level of 1,040-feet. ,Inflows at Mangla were recorded at 33,200 cusecs against outflows of 28,000 cusecs.

The agricultural economy has a 19 per cent share in GDP and engages 42.3pc of labour force.,Although the government has fixed higher cotton crop production target for 2018-19 season at 14.37 million bales, so far the sowing of cotton which starts early in April in lower Sindh has yet to commence.,The growers in lower areas of Sindh like Tando Adam, Shahdadpur and Hyderabad as usual started sowing cotton crop but after receiving no water their entire exercise went in vain.,Dr Jassumal Neemani former chairman Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA) talking to Dawn from Hyderabad said that hardly 25 per cent of cotton sowing has been down so far in lower Sindh and 75 per cent has yet to be done because growers are waiting for irrigation water.,He feared that cotton from Sindh fields normally start reaching ginneries from June 15 each year but due to delay in sowing the crop would not be available before July 15, or may even go beyond this timeline.,Southern Sindh and Rahim Yar Khan cotton badly damaged, Kharif crops at stake,A farmer based in Badin, with lands in the tail end of Akram Wah canal originating from Kotri barrage, tells Dawn that the shortages have sparked a highly politicised allocation of water between the perennial and six month canals, adversely impacting those lands fed by canals that do not feed the lands of powerful individuals connected with the provincial government.,“Much of the sugarcane crop is burnt since it has not been getting water since January” he tells Dawn. “Red chilli, which is planted latest by April 15 is also gone. Cotton, which should be planted latest by first week of May is also a casualty, since the water was supposed to come on Monday but it has not come, and what is on the way is less than one foot, which will reduce to two inches by the time it reaches the watercourses. Its a disaster!” he exclaims.,In Khoski and Shadi Large also in southern Badin, scuffles have been reported among people gathered at filter plants for drinking water.,Similar situation exists in Punjab which normally has an advantage of being upper riparian and historically Sindh always complained of being deprived from its due share of irrigation water.,But today both the leading provinces in agriculture sector are faced with similar situation of acute shortage of irrigation water to the extent that all the Kharif crops are at stake. ,Talking to Dawn via telephone, Mian Mahmood Ahmed, a leading ginner and founder member of Rahimyar Khan Chamber, said that being member of district coordination committee, he attended a meeting in the Deputy Commissioner’s office on Monday in this regard. “The water situation is so grim that people were not interested in getting irrigation water but were asking for drinking water,” he said.  ,Mr Ahmed further said that due to no irrigation water, people complained that they even don’t have green fodder (chaara) for their animals. ,He said that since December last year, irrigation water was not available but at the government level it seems the policy makers are least worried and are leading normal life.

"May 02, 2018","Suicide bombers killed more than 60 people at a mosque and a market in northeast Nigeria on Tuesday, in a twin attack bearing the hallmarks of Boko Haram and a day after US President Donald Trump pledged greater support to fight the militants. ,The blasts, said to have been carried out by young boys, happened shortly after 1:00 pm (1200 GMT) in Mubi, some 200 kilometres (125 miles) from the Adamawa state capital, Yola. ,Imam Garki, from the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), said a joint assessment with the police and Red Cross found that 26 people were killed and 56 were injured, 11 of them critically. ,They were transferred to the Federal Medical Centre in Yola for treatment. ,But a medical source at the Mubi General Hospital said they had received 37 bodies, while a rescue worker involved in the relief operation said he counted 42 dead and 68 injured. ,“These I saw with my own eyes. We were counting as they were being taken,” said Sani Kakale. ,Two local residents who attended funerals for the victims said the death toll was much higher — and could climb further. ,“Before I left the cemetery I took part in the burial of 68 people. More bodies were being brought by families of the victims,” said Muhammad Hamidu. ,“I think this is the worst attack Mubi has ever witnessed. The human loss is unimaginable.” Abdullahi Labaran added: “We left 73 freshly dug graves where each victim was buried. There are still unclaimed bodies at the hospital. ,Conflicting death tolls are not unusual in Nigeria. The authorities have also previously played down casualty figures. ,Suspicion for the attack immediately fell on Boko Haram, the militant group whose quest to establish a hardline Islamic state in northeast Nigeria has left at least 20,000 dead since 2009. ,Mubi has been repeatedly targeted in attacks blamed on Boko Haram since it was briefly overrun by the militants in late 2014. ,Nigeria's government and military have long maintained that the Islamic State group affiliate is a spent force and on the verge of defeat. ,But there has been no let-up in attacks in the northeast, particularly in Borno state, adjacent to Adamawa, which has been the epicentre of the violence. ,Last Thursday, at least four people were killed when suicide bombers and fighters attempted to storm the Borno state capital, Maiduguri, raising fresh questions about security. ,Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has been in the United States this week and met his US counterpart Donald Trump, who pledged more support in the fight against Boko Haram. ,Nigeria has bought a dozen A-29 Super Tucano light fighter aircraft in a $496-million (413-million-euro) deal. 
Trump indicated a further order for attack helicopters was also in the pipeline. ,“These new aircraft will improve Nigeria's ability to target terrorists and protect civilians,” Trump told a joint news conference with Buhari in Washington on Monday. ,The sale of the aircraft was previously blocked by the Obama administration after the Nigerian airforce mistakenly bombed a camp for people displaced by Boko Haram, killing 112. ,US military officials in Abuja have recently questioned Nigerian tactics faced with guerilla tactics from Boko Haram. ,“How they think in terms of combat, in my opinion, is still thinking of things as conventional warfare,” Lieutenant-Colonel Sean McClure, the US defence attach in Abuja, told , last month. ,In Mubi, local volunteer Habu Saleh, who was involved in the rescue effort, described the aftermath of the bombing as “chaos”. ,Health workers from the hospital mobilised to attend to the victims, despite being on strike over pay and conditions. ,Abdullahi Labaran said the first bomber mingled with worshippers who had gathered for prayers at the mosque at the edge of the market. ,He detonated his explosives “five minutes before the prayer started”, he added. ,The second bomber blew himself up among the crowds of worshippers, traders and shoppers as they fled the first explosion. ,On November 21, 2017 at least 50 people were killed when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a mosque during early morning prayers in the Unguwar Shuwa area of Mubi. ,In October 2012, at least 40 people were killed in an attack on student housing in Mubi that was widely blamed on Boko Haram. ,In June 2014, at least 40 football supporters, including women and children, died in a bomb attack after a match in the Kabang area of the town.",2018-05-02,https://www.dawn.com/news/1405016/more-than-60-killed-in-twin-suicide-blasts-in-northeast-nigeria,"More than 60 killed in twin suicide blasts in northeast Nigeria

"May 02, 2018","ISLAMABAD: While the federal government has already announced it has ,, power loadshedding returned with a bang on Tuesday when the mercury rose to 49 degrees centigrade in some parts of the country and transmission system and power plants tripped amid falling fuel stocks.,For the power shortfall, which exceeded 5,000 megawatts, the energy ministry’s power division looking after the national grid and distribution system attributed the revival of power outages to unavailability of Balloki, Bhikki, Haveli Bahadur Shah power plants, four nuclear plants, Neelum-Jhelum and other hydropower stations. ,Officials in the petroleum division of the ministry of energy said it was just the beginning as furnace oil stocks were at a very low level and the oil shipments due to the belated permission given by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi might not arrive before May 3. ,“Even arrival of ships alone is not enough,” said a senior petroleum division official. He said the entire supply chain from berthing to product offloading, pumping to the pipeline or tankers, and its transportation to power houses required between three and 15 days, depending on the location of the power plants in Karachi or Lahore. ,“It would, therefore, require a seamless coordination among the operational entities — PSO, port authorities, transport operators, power plant operators and the two divisions concerned — to work day and night” to complete the process, he added. ,Furnace oil shipments to arrive in next two weeks due to delayed permission by PM for import ,“The margin of error is zero this time,” the official said, adding that any delay would cost the PML-N government high before the upcoming general elections as it had already announced it had overcome power shortage. ,While the officials said the overall shortfall excee­ded 5,000MW, informed sources said the power cuts to the consumers hovered between 7,000MW and 8,000MW including transformational, transmission and distribution losses as well as non-withdrawal of power by distribution companies. The network operators had to resort to forced loadshedding to avoid system collapse. ,As a result, consumers in category-1 (feeders having less than 10 per cent loss areas) also suffered four- to six-hour-long power cuts though they are out of the approved load management policy of the government. ,The power division auth­orities claimed the situation was almost under control but warned that the next 36 hours could be critical. ,On Tuesday evening, the power division directed the distribution companies to limit their power withdrawals within approved quota and ensure that category-1 feeders, comprising 61 per cent of service areas, suffer the least and park maximum shortage in high-loss areas. Such areas, therefore, suffered prolonged power cuts ranging between 12 and 14 hours a day. ,The petroleum division officials said the fuel stock at the Hubco plant was less than three days of consumption while Bin Qasim plant of K-Electric had five-day stocks. The situation in Punjab was not well either. ,They said all the six ships transporting a total of 420,000 tonnes of fuel would arrive between May 3 and 14. ,“Power production will fall drastically ahead of the holy month of Ramazan if the supply chain is not managed effectively,” said a senior petroleum division official. ,He added that the countrywide stocks had been depleting fast since the time when an urgent tender was floated in the early April 2018 by PSO following instructions of the economic coordination committee of the cabinet. ,“The stock available for use with power generation companies across the country is depleting fast while the situation with Karachi-based power generation units is critical with furnace oil stock available only for consumption only less than a week,” the official said. ,Only a few days ago, the government directed the Pakistan State Oil (PSO) to float a tender to urgently order furnace oil cargo. The government had decided in January to ban the import of furnace oil.,PSO’s total receivables on Tuesday stood at Rs312 billion, including Rs261 billion payable by power sector, Rs26 billion by gas companies for LNG and Rs26 billion by PIA and the government. ,A power division spokesman said the 220kV National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) high-transmission circuits such as 220kV Daudkhel, 220kV Bannu, 220kV Ludewala and the four Chashma Nuclear Power Plants of 1,200MW tripped at 1:30am on Tuesday. In a written statement, the spokesman said supply to these power plants (C-I, C-II, C-III and C-IV) had been restored by mid-day and 220kV NTDC lines energized. However, the restoration of generation from these plants would take time as a definite protocol had to be followed, the statement said. ,The spokesman also said the RLNG-based power plants — Havelli Bahadar Shah, Bhikki and Balloki (with a total generation capacity of 3,600MW) — were in a testing phase with no power generation from these plants currently available. The hydropower generation was also low due to the low water release from reservoirs. Besides, he added, the new Neelum-Jehlum power plants, too, were in testing phase. ,The power division spokesman described the situation of the national grid as “temporary due to unavoidable situation”. He said the consumers would be provided relief as soon as any plant would start generation. He appealed to the consumers to adopt energy conservation practices.",2018-05-02,https://www.dawn.com/news/1405137/loadshedding-rears-its-head-as-fuel-stocks-dip,"Loadshedding rears its head as fuel stocks dip

Why after three years has he decided to speak the truth? I would like to know if Mr Zardari was so innocent and simple that he was duped by me,” Mr Sharif said in a statement in response to Mr Zardari’s reported comments about him. ,Mr Zardari, however, ,. “If you want to speak against me, you can, but do not say you are reacting to a statement which I have not given,” he was reported to have told Geo News in response to Mr Sharif’s statement. ,The Bilawal House had also denied the remarks attributed to the PPP leader on Monday. ,Mr Sharif asked the PPP leader to tell the people if he was speaking his (Nawaz) language at that time and “whose language he is speaking today”. ,Mr Zardari had reportedly termed Mr Sharif “far more cunning and opportunistic”, saying his “hard-hitting statement [against the establishment]” was in fact a gambit by Mr Sharif who tried to use this to settle his matters with then army chief Gen Raheel Sharif. ,PPP co-chairman denies issuing any such statement ,He also accused Mr Sharif of ditching the PPP on the matter of former president retired General Pervez Musharraf. “The PPP wanted to impeach Musharraf but instead of supporting the move, Nawaz Sharif backtracked. When Nawaz Sharif filed a sedition case against Musharraf, we supported the move but he [Nawaz] let him [Musharraf] leave the country under some deal.” ,Mr Zardari had left the country after this speech and remained abroad in ‘self-exile’ for 18 months or so. In that speech, Mr Zardari had remarked: “Army chiefs come and go every three years, but the political leadership is here to stay. We know the country better and we know how to run its affairs.” ,Clarifying on the matter of Mr Musharraf, Mr Sharif said: “Differences with Musharraf do not mean that one takes on an institution [army]. We had set certain conditions to be part of the PPP government [in 2008]. These included impeachment of Musharraf, restoration of judges and repeal of the 17th Amendment. I would like to ask Zardari who ditched whom. Not keeping his words Zardari had said such agreements were not the words of Hadith and the Quran.” ,The former prime minister also reminded Mr Zardari that he had come to him at his Raiwind residence along with a national political leader and insisted that all acts of Mr Musharraf should be validated by parliament, but “I refused straightaway”. ,Responding to Mr Zardari and other PPP leaders’ claim that he (Nawaz) had ensured the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) actions against some PPP leaders in Sindh, Mr Sharif said: “NAB got active in Sindh on the order of then Rangers director general and Zardari and Dr Asim know this very well.” He advised Mr Zardari to “stop this kind of politics” as the people were sick of behind-the-scenes conspiracies. “This is the reason the PPP has become confined to the interior of Sindh.” ,Taunting the PPP co-chairman for working for someone else and not for the people of Pakistan, Mr Sharif said: “Asif Zardari wants to put his weight behind someone else instead of the people. Mr Zardari should tell to whose tune he is dancing today.” ,Reiterating his election narrative — give respect to the ballot — Mr Sharif said he was busy in his ideological struggle and his mission was to restore the rule of the people in the country. ,The PPP leadership often says that it had shaken hands with the Sharifs for the supremacy of democracy but they used the former for their political gains.",2018-05-02,https://www.dawn.com/news/1405134/nawaz-breaks-his-silence-on-zardaris-allegations,"Nawaz breaks his silence on Zardari’s ‘allegations’

But the bureau did not entertain the complaint then, observing that it could not proceed against the retired army officers due to a constitutional bar. ,According to a recent judgement of the Islamabad High Court, the bureau erred in misinterpreting the provisions of the NAB Ordinance of 1999 by refusing to consider and entertain the complaint. The IHC judgement enabled the anti-graft body to probe the allegations of corruption against the retired army officers.,The complainant accused former military dictator Gen Musharraf of misusing his authority and position, and of violating both human rights and laws of the country.,As per the complaint, “Mr Musharraf misused his authority by extending favours to chosen subordinates. He is accused of giving senior officials in the armed forces a number of plots over and above their entitlements.”,The complainant alleged that Gen Musharraf had allotted more than 85 plots — both commercial and residential — to then vice chief of army staff Gen Yousaf Khan.,Gen Musharraf, who took over by overthrowing the government of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, during his “illegal tenure” had twice suspended the Constitution, the complainant said. He further alleged that the military dictator had ordered the assassination of Nawab Akbar Bugti, removed and detained judges, ‘master-minded mass murder’ in Karachi on May 12, 2007, and proclaimed a state of emergency that was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in July 2009.,Meanwhile, the decision of the Supreme Court registrar office to return a petition against supply of ‘spurious medicines’ to 27 combined military hospitals was challenged by the complainant, retired colonel Inam-ur-Rahim, by moving a fresh application before the apex court.,The SC registrar had returned the petition on April 17, raising the objection that the petitioner had neither approached any other forum available to him before moving the apex court nor did he provide any justification for it.,In his petition, Advocate Rahim blamed senior hierarchy of the armed forces, including former army chief Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the former commander of 11 Corps and defence secretary Asif Yaseen Malik, for their alleged links to the manufacturing and supply of spurious medicine to 27 CMHs and local markets.,The petitioner alleged that the young army officers and soldiers evacuated to the military hospitals after being hit by bullets in incidents such as the 2011 Salala post attack were unaware that they would be treated with “spurious medicines and injections”. ,In his fresh application filed against the registrar’s decision, Col Rahim conceded that there was another forum in the shape of NAB, but it took five long years to initiate an inquiry into allegations against former army chief Gen Pervez Musharraf and former vice chief of army staff Gen Yousaf Khan, and that too after the intervention of the Islamabad High Court.",2018-05-02,https://www.dawn.com/news/1405130/nab-seeks-details-of-musharrafs-misuse-of-authority,"NAB seeks details of Musharraf’s ‘misuse of authority’

A week before the anno­u­ncement of the election schedule, President Mamnoon Hussain, in consultation with the ECP, would anno­unce the date for elections, he added. ,He pointed out that under Section 57 (1) of the Elections Act, the president would announce the date or dates of the elections after consultation with the commission, while under sub-section 2 within seven days of the announcement, the commission would, through a notification in the official gazette and by publication on its website, call on the voters of the notified assembly constituencies to elect their representatives. ,The ECP official said delimitation of constituencies and electoral rolls would be notified in a few days. He said the appointment of district returning officers (DROs) and returning officers (ROs) would be made soon after issuance of the notification of delimitation of constituencies. He said the DROs and ROs would be drawn from the judiciary and lists had already been received from the high courts. The DROs and ROs will be imparted five-day training during the current month. ,Delimitation of constituencies, electoral rolls to be notified in a few days, to be followed by appointment of returning officers ,When asked to comment on the objection of Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Syed Khursheed Shah over ‘the ECP’s failure’ to announce an action plan for the elections four months before the polls, the official said the preparation of an action plan, and not announcement, was a legal requirement. ,He said Section 14 (1) of the Elections Act referred to by the opposition leader read, “The Commission shall, at least four months before the general election is due to be held on expiry of the term of an Assembly, prepare a comprehensive Action Plan specifying all legal and administrative measures that have been taken or required to be taken in respect of the election…” He said the commission had prepared an action plan and was on track. ,The opposition leader had also said that under Section 22 of the Elections Act, the ECP was required to notify new constituencies 120 days before the election date. He had said the ECP was due to notify delimitation of constituencies on May 4, which meant that the elections should be held in the first week of September. On the other hand, he said, the National Assembly was completing its term on June 1 and under the Constitution the elections should be held within 60 days after the expiry of the five-year term of the assembly. ,When asked to comment on this, the ECP official admitted that the act would have to be violated, but insisted that the Constitution was supreme. He said the ECP was not responsible for delayed passage of the Elections Act. “We have not wasted a single day and have started delimitation exercise as per dictates of the law immediately after the passage of the act.

"May 02, 2018","			,In a variety of Islamic political contexts around the world today, we see ‘Sufi’ ideas being invoked as a call to , to a deeper, more inward-directed (and more peaceful) mode of religious experience as compared to the one that results in outward-oriented political engagements that are often seen as negative and violent. A hundred years ago, it would not have been uncommon to hear western or West-influenced native voices condemn Islamic mysticism (often described problematically in English as ‘Sufism’) as one of the major sources of inertia and passivity within Muslim societies. Yet new political contingencies, especially after 9/11, have led to this same phenomenon being described as ‘the soft face of Islam’, with observers such as British writer William Dalrymple referring to a vaguely defined group of people called ‘the Sufis’ as ‘our’ best friends vis-à-vis the danger posed by Taliban-like forces. ,We seem to be in a situation where journalistic discourse and policy debates celebrate idealised notions of Islamic mysticism with its enthralling music, inspiring poetry and the transformative/liberating potential of the ‘message’ of the great mystics. These mystics are clearly differentiated from more ‘closed-minded’ and ‘orthodox’ representatives of the faith such as preachers (mullahs), theologians (,) and other types of ulema.,On the other hand, when we trace the institutional legacy of these great mystics (walis/shaikhs) and spiritual guides (pirs) down to their present-day spiritual heirs, we find out that they are often all too well-entrenched in the social and political status quo. The degree of their sociopolitical influence has even become electorally quantifiable since the introduction of parliamentary institutions during colonial times. Pirs in Pakistan have been visible as powerful party leaders (Pir Pagara), ministers (Shah Mahmood Qureshi) and even prime ministers (Yousaf Raza Gillani). Even more traditional religious figures, such as Pir Hameeduddin Sialvi (who recently enjoyed media attention for threatening to withdraw support from the ruling party over a religious issue that unites many types of religious leaders), not only exercise considerable indirect influence over the vote but have also served as members of various legislative forums. ,It is, therefore, unclear what policymakers mean when they call for investment in the concepts and traditions of ‘Sufi Islam’. Is it an appeal for the promotion of a particular kind of religious ethic through the public education system? Or is it a call for raising the public profile of little known faqirs and dervishes and for strengthening the position of existing , (hereditary representatives of pirs and mystics and the custodians of their shrines), many of whom already enjoy a high level of social and political prominence and influence? Or are policymakers referring to some notion of Islamic mysticism that has remained very much at the level of poetic utterance or philosophical discourse — that is, at the level of the ideal rather than at the level of reality as lived and experienced by Muslims over centuries? ,The salience of idealised notions of Islamic mysticism in various policy circles today makes it interesting to examine the historical relations that mystic groups within Islamic societies have had with the ruling classes and the guardians of religious law. What has the typical relationship among kings, ulema and mystics been, for example, in regions such as Central Asia, Anatolia, Persia and Mughal India that fall in a shared Persianate cultural and intellectual zone? Has , (Islamic mysticism) historically been a passive or apolitical force in society, or have prominent mystics engaged with politics and society in ways that are broadly comparable to the way other kinds of religious representatives have done so?,It is instructive to turn first to the life of an Islamic mystic who is perhaps more celebrated and widely recognised than any other: Maulana Jalaluddin Rumi (d. 1273). He lived in Konya in modern-day Turkey. The fame of his mystic verse has travelled far and wide, but what is less widely known is that he had received a thorough training in fiqh (Islamic law). ,Historical accounts show that he had studied the Quran and fiqh at a very high level in some of the most famous madrasas in Aleppo and Damascus. Later, he served as a teacher of fiqh at several madrasas. In this, he appears to have followed his father who was a religious scholar at a princely court in Anatolia and taught at an institution that blended the functions of a madrasa and those of a ,, demonstrating how fluid the relationship between an Islamic law college and a mystic lodge could be in Islamic societies. Even madrasas built exclusively for training ulema have often been paired with , since centuries.,			,Biographers have described how Rumi’s legal opinions were frequently sought on a variety of subjects. As a spiritual guide and preacher, he regularly delivered the Friday sermon (,), achieving popularity as an acclaimed speaker and attracting a considerable number of disciples from all parts of society. His followers included merchants and artisans as well as members of the ruling class. His lectures were attended by both women and men in Konya. For much of this while, he was also composing his renowned poetry and becoming identified with his own style of , and dance, which sometimes drew criticism from other ulema, many of whom nevertheless continued to revere him.,It is evident from Rumi’s letters that he also had extremely close relations with several Seljuk rulers, even referring to one of them as ‘son’. It was not rare for him to advise these rulers on various points of statesmanship and make recommendations (for instance, on relations with infidel powers) in light of religious strictures and political expediencies. He is also known to have written letters to introduce his disciples and relatives to men of position and influence who could help them professionally or socially. Unlike his religious sermons and ecstatic poetry, these letters follow the conventions typically associated with correspondence addressed to nobles and state officials.,All this contradicts the idea that mystics (,) are always firmly resistant to interacting with rulers. The stereotypical image of mystics is one where they are far too caught up in contemplation of the divine to have anything to do with the mundane political affairs of the world. Yet in sharp contrast to this image, many prominent mystics in Islamic history have played eminent roles in society and politics. ,This holds true not only for the descendants of prominent mystics who continue to wield considerable sociopolitical influence in Muslim countries such as today’s Egypt and Pakistan but also for the , in whose names various mystical orders were originally founded. These , evidently lived very much in the world, not unlike nobles and kings and many classes of the ulema. ,Rumi’s life also offers evidence that the two worlds of , and madrasa, often considered vastly different from each other, all too often overlap in terms of their functions. Regardless of the impressions created by mystic poetry’s derogatory allusions to the , (zealous ascetic), , (preacher) or shaikh (learned religious scholar), there is little practical reason to see mystics on the whole as being fundamentally opposed to other leaders and representatives of religion. In fact, right through until modern times, we have seen ulema and , work in tandem with each other in the pursuit of shared religio-political objectives, the Khilafat movement in British India being just one such example among many of their collaborations.,Rumi’s activities are indicative of a nearly ubiquitous pattern of political involvement by prominent mystics in various Islamic societies. In Central Asia, support from the , of the Naqshbandi mystical order (,) seems to have become almost indispensable by the end of the 15th century for anyone aspiring to rule since the order had acquired deep roots within the population at large. The attachment of Timurid and Mughal rulers to the Naqshbandi order is well known. The Shaybanid rulers of Uzbek origin also had deep ties with the order and Naqshbandi , tended to play a prominent role in mediating between Mughal and Uzbek rulers. ,Naqshbandis are somewhat unusual among Sufi orders in their historical inclination towards involving themselves in political affairs, and for favouring fellowship (,) over seclusion (,), yet political interventions are not rare even among other orders.,			,Closer to home, Shaikh Bahauddin Zakariya (d. 1262), a Suhrawardi mystic, is reported to have negotiated the peaceful surrender of Multan to the Mongols, giving 10,000 dinars in cash to the invading army’s commander in return for securing the lives and properties of the citizens. Suhrawardis, indeed, have long believed in making attempts to influence rulers to take religiously correct decisions. Bahauddin Zakariya was very close to Sultan Iltutmish of the Slave Dynasty of Delhi and was given the official post of Shaikhul Islam. He openly sided with the sultan when Nasiruddin Qabacha, the governor of Multan, conspired to overthrow him. ,It is widely known that the Mughal king Jahangir was named after Shaikh Salim Chishti (d. 1572) but what is less well known is that his great-grandfather Babar’s name ‘Zahiruddin Muhammad’ was chosen by Naqshbandi shaikh Khwaja Ubaidullah Ahrar (d. 1490), who wielded tremendous political power in Central Asia. The shaikh’s son later asked Babar to defend Samarkand against the Uzbeks. When Babar fell ill in India many years later, he versified one of Khwaja Ahrar’s works in order to earn the shaikh’s blessings for his recovery.,Even after Babar lost control of his Central Asian homeland and India became his new dominion, he and his descendants maintained strong ties with Central Asian Naqshbandi orders such as Ahrars, Juybaris and Dahbidis. This affiliation was not limited to the spiritual level. It also translated into important military and administrative posts at the Mughal court being awarded to generations of descendants of Naqshbandi shaikhs.,The offspring of these shaikhs also often became favoured marriage partners for royal princesses, thus becoming merged with the nobility itself. One of Babar’s daughters as well as one of Humayun’s was given in marriage to the descendants of Naqshbandi shaikhs. The two emperors also married into the family of the shaikhs of Jam in Khurasan. Akbar’s mother, Hamida Banu (Maryam Makani), was descended from the renowned shaikh Ahmad-e-Jam (d. 1141).,In India, Mughal princes and kings also established important relationships with several other mystical orders such as the Chishtis and Qadris. In particular, the Shattari order (that originated in Persia) grew to have significant influence over certain Mughal kings. It seems to have been a common tendency among members of the Mughal household to pen hagiographical tributes to their spiritual guides. Dara Shikoh, for example, wrote tazkirahs (biographies) of his spiritual guide Mian Mir (d. 1635) and other Qadri shaikhs. His sister Jahanara wrote about the Chishti shaikhs of Delhi.,So great was the royal reverence for mystics that several Mughal emperors, like their counterparts outside India, wanted to be buried beside the graves of prominent shaikhs. Aurangzeb, for example, was buried beside a Chishti shaikh, Zainuddin Shirazi (d. 1369). Muhammad Shah’s grave in Delhi is near that of another Chishti shaikh, Nizamuddin Auliya (d. 1325). ,Like several other Mughal and Islamic rulers, Aurangzeb’s life demonstrates a devotion to a number of different mystical orders (Chishtis, Shattaris and Naqshbandis) at various points in his life. The emperor is reported to have sought the blessings of Naqshbandis during his war of succession with his brother Dara Shikoh. Naqshbandi representatives not only committed themselves to stay by his side in the battle but they also vowed to visit Baghdad to pray at the tomb of Ghaus-e-Azam Abdul Qadir Jilani (d. 1166) for his victory. They similarly promised to mobilise the blessings of the ulema and , living in the holy city of Makkah in his favour. ,			,The combined spiritual and temporal power of influential , across various Islamic societies meant that rulers were eager to seek their political support and spiritual blessings for the stability and longevity of their rule. Benefits accrued to both sides. The , approval and support bolstered the rulers’ political position, and financial patronage by rulers and wealthy nobles, in turn, served to strengthen the social and economic position of , who often grew to be powerful landowners. The estates and dynasties left behind by these shaikhs frequently outlasted those of their royal patrons.,This is not to say that every prominent mystic had equally intimate ties with rulers. Some , (particularly among Chishtis) are famous for refusing to meet kings and insisting on remaining aloof from the temptations of worldly power. Shaikh Nizamuddin Auliya’s response to Alauddin Khilji’s repeated requests for an audience is well known: “My house has two doors. If the Sultan enters by one, I will make my exit by the other.” In effect, however, even these avowedly aloof , often benefited from access to the corridors of royal power via their disciples among the royal household and high state officials. ,The relationship between sultans and , was also by no means always smooth. From time to time, there was a real breakdown in their ties. Shaikhs faced the prospect of being exiled, imprisoned or even executed if their words or actions threatened public order or if they appeared to be in a position to take over the throne. The example of Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi (d. 1624) is famous. He was imprisoned by Jahangir for a brief period reportedly because his disquietingly elevated claims about his own spiritual rank threatened to disrupt public order. Several centuries earlier, Sidi Maula was executed by Jalaluddin Khilji, who suspected the shaikh of conspiring to seize his throne.,It is not only through influence over kings and statesmen that Islamic mystical orders have historically played a political role. Some of them are known to have launched direct military campaigns. Contrary to a general notion in contemporary popular discourse that ‘Sufism’ somehow automatically means ‘peace’, some Islamic mystical orders have had considerable military recruiting potential.,The Safaviyya mystical order of Ardabil in modern day Iranian Azerbaijan offers a prominent example of this. Over the space of almost two centuries, this originally Sunni mystical order transformed itself into a fighting force. With the help of his army of Qizilbash disciples, the first Safavid ruler Shah Ismail I established an enduring Shia empire in 16th century Iran.,In modern times, Pir Pagara’s Hurs in Sindh during the British period offer another example of a pir’s devotees becoming a trained fighting force. It is not difficult to find other examples in Islamic history of , who urged sultans to wage wars, accompanied sultans on military expeditions and inspired their disciples to fight in the armies of favoured rulers. Some are believed to have personally participated in armed warfare.,			,To speak of a persistent difference between the positions of ulema and mystics on the issue of war or jihad would be, thus, a clear mistake. ‘Sufism’ on the whole is hardly outside the mainstream of normative Islam on this issue, as on others. ,Another popular misconception is to speak of ‘Sufism’ as something peculiar to the South Asian experience of Islam or deem it to be some indigenously developed, soft ‘variant’ of Islam that is different from the ‘harder’ forms of the religion prevalent elsewhere. Rituals associated with piri-muridi (master-disciple) relationships and visits to dargahs can, indeed, display the influence of local culture and differ significantly from mystical rituals in other countries and regions. ,However, the main trends and features defining Islamic mysticism in South Asia remain pointedly similar to those characterising Islamic mysticism in the Middle East and Central Asia. As British scholar Nile Green points out, “What is often seen as being in some way a typically South Asian characteristic of Islam – the emphasis on a cult of Sufi shrines – was in fact one of the key practices and institutions of a wider Islamic cultural system to be introduced to South Asia at an early period ... It is difficult to understand the history of Sufism in South Asia without reference to the several lengthy and distinct patterns of immigration into South Asia of holy men from different regions of the wider Muslim world, chiefly from Arabia, the fertile crescent, Iran and Central Asia.”,It is a fact that all the major mystical orders in South Asia have their origins outside this region. Even the Chishti order, which has come to be associated more closely with South Asia than with any other region, originated in Chisht near Herat in modern-day Afghanistan. These interregional connections have consistently been noted and celebrated by masters and disciples connected with mystic orders over time. Shaikh Ali al-Hujweri (d. circa 1072-77), who migrated from Ghazna in Afghanistan to settle in Lahore, is known and revered as Data Ganj Bakhsh. Yet this does not mean that the status of high ranking shaikhs who lived far away from the Subcontinent is lower than his in any way. Even today, the cult of Ghaus-e-Azam of Baghdad continues to be popular in South Asia.,For anyone who has the slightest acquaintance with Muslim history outside the Subcontinent, it would be difficult to defend the assertion – one that we hear astoundingly often in both lay and academic settings in South Asia – that ‘Sufi Islam’ is somehow particular to Sindh or Punjab in specific or to the Indian subcontinent more broadly. It is simply not possible to understand the various strands of Islamic mysticism in our region without reference to their continual interactions with the broader Islamic world.,What is mystical experience, after all? The renowned Iranian scholar Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub defines it as an “attempt to attain direct and personal communication with the godhead” and argues that mysticism is as old as humanity itself and cannot be confined to any race or religion.,It would, therefore, be quite puzzling if Islamic mysticism had flowered only in the Indian subcontinent and in no other Muslim region, as some of our intellectuals seem to assert. Islamic mysticism in South Asia owes as much to influences from Persia, Central Asia and the Arab lands as do most other aspects of Islam in our region. These influences are impossible to ignore when we study the lives and works of the mystics themselves. ,As Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi (,) wrote in the 16th-17th century: “We ... Muslims of India ... are so much indebted to the ulema and Sufis (,) of Transoxiana (,) that it cannot be conveyed in words. It was the ulema of the region who strove to correct the beliefs [of Muslims] to make them consistent with the sound beliefs and opinions of the followers of the Prophet’s tradition and the community (,). It was they who reformed the religious practices [of the Muslims] according to Hanafi law. The travels of the great Sufis (may their graves be hallowed) on the path of this sublime Sufi order have been introduced to India by this blessed region.” *,These influences were not entirely one-way. We see that the Mujaddidi order (developed in India by Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi as an offshoot of the Naqshbandi order) went on to exert a considerable influence in Central Asia and Anatolia. This demonstrates once again how interconnected these regions had been at the intellectual, literary and commercial levels before the advent of colonialism.,			,This essay has been an attempt to dispel four myths about Islamic mysticism. The first myth is that there is a wide gap between the activities of the mystic , and those of the scholarly madrasa (and that there is, thus, a vast difference between ‘Sufi’ Islam and normative/mainstream Sunni Islam). The second myth is that mystics are ‘passive’, apolitical and withdrawn from the political affairs of their time. The third myth is that mystics across the board are intrinsically ‘peaceful’ and opposed to armed jihad or warfare. The last myth is that Islamic mysticism is a phenomenon particular to, or intrinsically more suited to, the South Asian environment as compared to other Islamic lands.,All these four points are worth taking into consideration in any meaningful policy discussion of the limits and possibilities of harnessing Islamic mysticism for political interventions in Muslim societies such as today’s Pakistan. It is important to be conscious of the fact that when we make an argument for promoting mystical Islam in this region, we are in effect making an argument for the promotion of mainstream Sunni (mostly Hanafi) Islam in its historically normative form. ,**Translation by Dr Sajida Alvi*",2018-05-02,https://herald.dawn.com/news/1398514/why-sufism-is-not-what-it-is-made-out-to-be,"Why ‘Sufism’ is not what it is made out to be

"May 02, 2018","LONDON: Tottenham Hotspur’s England duo Harry Kane and Dele Alli fired them to a comfortable 2-0 win over mid-table Watford that cemented their place in the top four at Wembley on Monday. ,The win put fourth-placed Spurs five points clear of Chelsea with three games remaining and within a point of Liverpool, who have two matches left, in the race for Champions League spots. ,Tottenham took the lead after 16 minutes when Watford keeper Orestis Karnezis spilled a cross from Kieran Trippier and Christian Eriksen scooped the ball to Alli who had the simple task of stroking the ball home from near the penalty spot. ,Kane put Spurs two goals ahead in the 48th when he tucked away a cross from the right by Trippier and they almost had a third when Jan Vertonghen hit the post with a late header. ,“Maybe it wasn’t the greatest performance but the aim is to win... it will be a successful season if we finish in the top four. To be in the Champions League will be a massive thing,” Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino told a news conference. ,Tottenham have 71 points ahead of London rivals Chelsea on 66, both from 35 games, while third-placed Liverpool have 72 from 36. Liverpool play Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. ,Chelsea looked like they would not be qualifying for the Champions League after losing to Tottenham at home on April 1, but have won their last three games to stay in contention in fifth place. ,“They were creeping up on our backs so now we can look forward,” Kane said. “It was important just to get the job done and ease that pressure.” ,Although Spurs ran out comfortable winners against Watford in front of England manager Gareth Southgate, they had France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris to thank for some fine first-half saves. ,After taking the early lead through Alli, the home side were almost made to pay for a sloppy pass by Eric Dier after 26 minutes that was intercepted by Etienne Capoue who fed Andre Gray but his low drive was saved by the diving Lloris. ,The Spurs keeper was called on again twice before halftime when he made a fine save to deny Richarlison and came rushing out of goal to make a well-timed tackle on Abdoulaye Doucoure. ,“We conceded a few chances but Hugo Lloris showed fantastic skill and that’s why he’s one of the best keepers in the world,” added Pochettino whose side kept a clean sheet for the first time in six league games thanks mainly to the France international. ,Tottenham, whose play had been untidy at times in the opening period, tightened up after the break and it was their talisman Kane who eased any remaining jitters with his 27th league goal of the season behind Liverpool’s Mo Salah on 31. ,Overhauling Salah looks a tough job, but Kane finished last season with eight goals in his final three games and he is hoping for a repeat, despite looking sluggish in recent performances. ,“I would have liked to play better over the last few games but the whole team would have liked to do that,” Kane said. “I feel good, I feel sharp. I probably could have scored a couple more today. I’m looking forward to the last three games. ,“Last year was an unbelievable end, but we’ll see what happens. In my mind, I’m just trying to get to that 30-goal mark.”, ,(Tabulated under played, won, drawn, lost, goals for, goals against, total):  ,Manchester City 35  30  3   2   102 26  93,Manchester United   35  24  5   6   67  27  77,Liverpool   36  20  12  4   80  37  72,Tottenham Hotspur   35  21  8   6   68  31  71,Chelsea 35  20  6   9   60  34  66,Arsenal 35  17  6   12  67  48  57,Burnley 36  14  12  10  35  32  54,Everton 36  13  9   14  42  54  48,Leicester City  35  11  11  13  49  52  44,Newcastle United    35  11  8   16  35  44  41,Crystal Palace  36  9   11  16  41  54  38,AFC Bournemouth 36  9   11  16  42  60  38,Watford 36  10  8   18  42  62  38,Brighton Hove   35  8   13  14  32  47  37,West Ham United 35  8   11  16  43  67  35,Huddersfield Town   35  9   8   18  27  56  35,Swansea City    35  8   9   18  27  52  33,Southampton 35  6   14  15  35  54  32,Stoke City  36  6   12  18  32  65  30,West Bromwich   36  5   13  18  30  54  28",2018-05-02,https://www.dawn.com/news/1405030/alli-kane-on-target-as-spurs-boost-champions-league-hopes,"Alli, Kane on target as Spurs boost Champions League hopes

The other was for Myanmar’s government to hold its own comprehensive inquiry.,Last month the chief prosecutor for the ICC asked judges to consider whether the court’s jurisdiction extends to Myanmar, which is not a member of the panel.,Suu Kyi, pilloried outside her country for failing to speak up for the Rohingya, promised to “undertake a proper investigation” where evidence of atrocities was found, Pierce said.,“It doesn’t matter whether it [a probe] is international or domestic, as long as it’s credible,” she added.,During his meeting late Monday with the UN envoys, Myanmar’s army chief denied his forces had committed rape and other sexual abuses during the crackdown which he ordered.,“The Tatmadaw [army] is always disciplined ... and takes action against anyone who breaks the law,” he told the delegates, according to a posting late Monday on his official Facebook page.,Rohingya women and girls in Bangladesh have provided consistent accounts of sexual violence — reports verified by conflict monitors — but Min Aung Hlaing said his forces have “no such history of sexual abuse”. “It is unacceptable according to the culture and religion of our country,” he said, adding anyone found guilty of crimes would be punished.,Min Aung Hlaing also repeated the official line that Myanmar was ready to take back those refugees who could be verified as residents, as per a repatriation deal with Bangladesh.,Several months after the deal was signed, no refugees have returned. They demand guarantees of safety, the right to return to their original villages and the granting of citizenship.,Another UN diplomat warned it would take “two or three years” for the refugees to be repatriated as the current timeframe to implement the deal continues to slip.,“There is a need to speed up the process,” said Mansour Ayyad Al-Otaibi, the Kuwaiti ambassador to the UN, adding conditions must be “safe and dignified” for return.,Bangladeshi accuses Myanmar of buying time by pretending to cooperate over repatriation for the benefit of the international community.,Myanmar says its neighbour has only handed back 8,000 repatriation forms so far, many of them incomplete, delaying the return process.,Myanmar denies the Rohingya citizenship and accompanying rights.,Since 2012 it has driven out two-thirds of its roughly 1.5 million Rohingya population.",2018-05-02,https://www.dawn.com/news/1405121/myanmar-urged-to-hold-proper-probe-into-alleged-atrocities-against-rohingya,"Myanmar urged to hold ‘proper’ probe into alleged atrocities against Rohingya

But IS fighters have retained a presence in a few areas of the country, including in the eastern oil-rich province of Deir Ezzor near the border with Iraq.,The SDF’s Deir Ezzor Military Council on Tuesday said it would press its efforts to oust IS from remaining areas. “Our forces with the forces of the international coalition have started the last stage” of the anti-IS campaign, it said in a statement.,The US State Department said later that the coalition and its “partners, including the Syrian Democratic Forces, are launching operations to liberate the final ISIS strongholds in Syria”. “The fighting will be difficult, but we and our partners will prevail... The days of ISIS controlling territory and terrorising the people of Syria are coming to an end,” it said in a statement., ,Air strikes killed at least 23 civilians including 10 children in a village held by the IS in northeastern Syria on Tuesday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said.  “We don’t know for the moment if the US-led international coalition or Iraqi forces carried out the strike” on the village of Al-Qasr in Hasakeh province, the Observatory said.,The Britain-based monitor relies on a network of sources on the ground for its information.

A separate shooting in eastern Khost province killed a BBC reporter.,“We anticipated and are doing our best and have been successful at blocking many of these attacks on innocent people, but unfortunately once in a while they get through,” Mattis said as he greeted Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Radmila Sekerinska.,“This is simply what they do: They murder innocent people.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has also condemned the “senseless and barbaric attack”. He said the work of those journalists who died “helped lay the foundation for Afghanistan’s thriving and resilient independent media”. ,As the Pentagon asserts that Afghan troops and US-led Nato forces are making steady progress in the 16.5-year-old Afghanistan war, a US watchdog on Tuesday warned that the Taliban and other insurgent groups are gaining control over increasing numbers of the Afghan population and the strength of local security forces has declined sharply.—AFP,An international media advocacy group asked the United Nations Secretary General on Tuesday to appoint a special representative for the protection of journalists after the latest attacks on media representatives in Afghanistan.,“We have formally referred this case to the United Nations Secretary General,” said Christophe Deloire, general secretary of the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders, which is better known by its French acronym RSF.,“It is high time that the UN sent a strong signal to the international community and to local protagonists by appointing a Special Representative for the protection of journalists,” Deloire added.,“Today marks one of the deadliest days on record for the media in Afghanistan and indeed around the world,” said Steve Butler, Asia Programme Coordinator for the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.,Anthony Bellanger, general secretary of the Brussels-based International Federation of Journalists noted that those targeted by the terrorists were “on duty to report about the earlier attack” and demanded “urgent action from the government to ensure justice for the slain journalists”.

A hearing was due on Wednesday to discuss a trial date.,Pell, who entered the court surrounded by a large police presence, was released on bail on condition he does not leave Australia. He has already handed in his passport.,The former Sydney and Melbourne archbishop has been on leave from the Vatican, returning to Australia to fight the allegations which relate to incidents that allegedly occurred long ago. The exact details and nature of the claims remain confidential, other than they involve “multiple complainants”. But some of the alleged offences were at a swimming pool in Ballarat in Victoria in the 1970s and at Melbourne’s St Patrick’s Cathedral in the 1990s, the court heard.,Several of the most serious allegations were dismissed due to inconsistencies in the evidence, including claims of offending at a cinema in Ballarat during a screening of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.,Lisa Flynn, a lawyer who has represented hundreds of abuse survivors in civil litigation claims in Australia, said the ruling proved no one was above the law.,“The charging of Pell for these alleged crimes reinforces that people should be and are treated equally in the eyes of the law,” she said. “This is a promising step forward for victims of sexual assault.” ,Pell’s case has coincided with an Australian national inquiry into child sexual abuse, ordered in 2012 after a decade of pressure to investigate widespread allegations of institutional paedophilia.,The inquiry commission spoke to thousands of victims and heard claims of abuse involving churches, orphanages, sporting clubs, youth groups and schools.,Pell appeared before it three times, once in person and twice via video-link from Rome over the Church’s handling of complaints against paedophile priests.,The cardinal admitted he “mucked up” in dealing with paedophile priests in the 1970s, but said he was deceived by senior clergy about what was happening and vehemently denied any responsibility.,In a brief statement, the Vatican said it had “taken note of the decision issued by judicial authorities in Australia” and added that Pell was still on a leave of absence granted by the pope to defend himself.,The Catholic Church globally has been plagued by allegations of sex abuse among priests. The scandals have haunted the papacy of Pope Francis, who in February announced the Vatican was renewing its anti-paedophile panel.,It followed a trip to Chile in January that was seen as a resounding failure after he defended a bishop accused of covering up the crimes of a paedophile priest.,Pell was one of the pope’s most trusted aides, handpicked by him in 2014 to make the Church’s finances more transparent.",2018-05-02,https://www.dawn.com/news/1405115/australias-top-catholic-cleric-to-stand-trial-on-sex-abuse-charges,"Australia’s top Catholic cleric to stand trial on sex abuse charges

We were counting as they were being taken,” said Sani Kakale.,Two local residents who attended funerals for the victims said the death toll was much higher — and could climb further.,“Before I left the cemetery I took part in the burial of 68 people. More bodies were being brought by families of the victims,” said Muhammad Hamidu.,“I think this is the worst attack Mubi has ever witnessed. The human loss is unimaginable.” Abdullahi Labaran added: “We left 73 freshly dug graves where each victim was buried.

"May 02, 2018","VIETNAM’S Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded by 6.81 per cent in 2017, marking its highest growth rate in a decade. The country continues to storm ahead this year, with the economy growing by 7.38 per cent in the first quarter — one of the fastest rates in Asia — and total growth is expected to be in the region of 6.7-6.8 per cent (the former as targeted by the National Assembly) for the year. It could even hit 7.1 per cent, according to the Asian Development Bank.,Looking ahead, the Vietna­mese government is seeking to maintain the country’s growth spurt until 2020, with Prime Minister Nguyn Xuân Phúc having spoken of moves encouraging private companies — which currently account for 43 per cent of GDP — to grow and boosting investment into rural areas.,Industry and construction are the engine rooms of this growth. Vit Nam’s competitiveness on wages, high labour productivity and a young population noted for a “can-do” attitude means it has proven particularly attractive as an “offshored” manufacturing hub.,Having started out in labour-orientated manufacturing, Vietnam has made huge progress with technology-intensive work, most notably electronics. Those with an outmoded perception of the country may be surprised to learn that Vietnam is ranked 18th among the world’s fastest-growing electronic exporters (mainly of finished goods, rather than just components like other countries) and that high-tech products have contributed around a quarter of GDP for several years now.,Smartphones are a huge part of this story, with Samsung factories being a case in point. Employing some 170,000 people, Samsung accounted for almost a quarter of Vietnam’s total exports last year. But the boost the South Korean electronics giant has wrought for Vietnam has been far reaching. As might be expected, its Thái Nguyên factory alongside its sister facility in Bc Ninh Province have transformed the fortunes of the locations in which they are based. Whole service economies have sprung up to feed, entertain and accommodate their workers and executives, along with whole networks of suppliers to the factories themselves, making these provinces among Vietnam’s richest. Thus, growth begets growth.,Samsung is just one example of how Vietnam is welcoming foreign industry since the country first opened up to it in 2015, most notably entering a trade pact with South Korea. Since then, the country has rapidly become remarkably outward-looking and open to free trade, with a deal soon to be inked with the European Union and Vit Nam being a founding member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.,As savvy fund managers all over the world know, all this means that Vietnam has a lot going for it as an investment prospect. Currently, investing in securities is looking very attractive indeed. Last year, the VN and HNX indexes soared by 48 per cent and 46 per cent respectively, with momentum still strong. Those picking real stock-market winners are said to have seen returns of up to 300 per cent — figures that have equity investment firms in the world over paying attention. Booming economic growth also naturally leads to big real estate opportunities, with investors both domestic and foreign piling in.,Of course, Vietnam is not without its issues, but even here very positive moves are being made. Poverty levels have improved rapidly, but progress still needs to be made and youth unemployment can be high, particularly among graduates. Over-reliance on the caprices of foreign investment is not enough, while international funding is tapering off as the country’s economy grows. Dynamic, socially useful business, rather than charity, has to be prioritised alongside plugging the skills gap, and domestic entrepreneurship must be nurtured if growth is to be sustained. In response, the Vietnamese Government has set out ambitions of creating a vibrant “start-up nation”, with a million new enterprises being born by 2020.,With social enterprise a big focus and strong government support (such as creating a special kind of legal form), Vietnam has created one of the most progressive ecosystems for these types of businesses in Southeast Asia. With this assistance, over 1,000 social enterprises have sprung up in Vietnam and most are now thriving as registered companies. Many other countries, even in the West, must look on jealously at such progressiveness.,Vietnamese dynamism is evident in every aspect of the country’s economy and its merits extend far beyond merely having a young, cheap and plentiful supply of workers – although that is clearly playing a great part. Challenges remain, not least the rise of global trade protectionism sparked by China and the US. I am not alone in being hugely optimistic, however. Vietnam has a rapidly-expanding middle class with aspirations to a Western lifestyle and all around I can see them getting there at ever greater speed.,There are a great many reasons why smart money is staying on Vietnam’s further growth.—",2018-05-02,https://www.dawn.com/news/1405105/why-smart-money-is-staying-on-vietnamese-growth,"Why smart money is staying on Vietnamese growth

"May 02, 2018","KARACHI: A war of words between the Pakistan Peoples Party and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan, the two former coalition partners, intensified on Tuesday as both sides traded serious allegations and held each other responsible for the miseries of Karachi and its people.,The first salvo was fired by PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Sunday while addressing a big public meeting in Liaquatabad’s Tanki Ground in which he called the MQM ‘Mustaqil Qaumi Museebat’ (permanent national disaster) and promised that if the people of Karachi voted for his party, he would rid them of the MQM for good.,And on Tuesday, Mr Bhutto-Zardari briefly spoke against the MQM at a press conference held in connection with May Day only when reporters persistently sought his opinion on the latter’s plan to hold a public meeting at the same venue where his party organised a show of strength on April 29.,Factions of Muttahida may hold joint public meeting, dare Bilawal to hold a rally in Lyari,“In connection with Labour Day, I would ask the MQM to first answer about the Baldia Town factory carnage that killed hundreds of poor labourers,” he said. “I love the people of Karachi and I will stage a rally in every district of my city. The MQM should not worry about me. There is a visible tilt in politics of Karachi, and the PPP is leading this [trend.]”,It appears that after Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s verbal onslaught on the fragmented MQM-P, its PIB and Bahadurabad groups — which had earlier announced that they would hold public meetings in Liaquatabad on May 4 and May 5, respectively — will sit together to formulate a united strategy to hold one public meeting against the PPP.,On Tuesday evening, MQM’s PIB group leader Ali Raza Abidi tweeted that Dr Farooq Sattar had announced holding a joint press conference on Wednesday with Bahadurabad group’s Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui “in order to hold One Muttahid Jalsa at the same location in reply to Bilawal’s Jalsi”.,Earlier on Tuesday, Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, who is the convener of the Bahadurabad group, held a press conference in which he directed his criticism at Mr Bhutto-Zardari and said that the PPP would be given a befitting reply at Liaquatabad’s Tanki Ground, where his party would hold a public meeting on May 5.,He said his party hoped that the PPP would have tried to win the hearts and minds of the people by announcing a big hospital or a medical college at their public meeting in Liaquatabad, but it did no such thing and only spread venom and hatred.,He said the PPP held its public meeting in a traditional MQM stronghold after 44 years only because its leader knew he was completely safe there. “But what fear is stopping you from holding such a public meeting in Lyari,” said Dr Siddiqui.,Terming the gangs in Lyari the “militant wing of the PPP”, he asked Mr Bhutto-Zardari to hold a public meeting in that neighbourhood to show that he had no fear there.,Responding to Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s taunt that the MQM-P had betrayed its leader Altaf Hussain, Dr Siddiqui said the whole party had stood by Mr Hussain for long, but dissociated itself from him only for Pakistan. “We can leave anyone for the sake of Pakistan.”,Also on Tuesday, MQM-P’s PIB group head Dr Farooq Sattar visited the Liaquatabad area and met people there. ,He said the area people told him they wanted unity of different groups and they had to hold one public meeting. ,He said on their demand he now left the issue of finalising date and day for holding one public meeting in Liaquatabad to Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui.,He said he was thankful to Mr Bhutto-Zardari as his party was going to hold one public meeting, and not two, because of the PPP leader.

The caffeine quantity should not exceed 200 mililitre and companies should avoid using pharmaceutical ingredients during preparation of the beverages.

"May 02, 2018","LAHORE: Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif has taken notice of a tweet of a young woman of a Christian family against a PML-N woman MPA, accusing the lawmaker of using the police to harass her family, according to the sources who say the CM has sought a detailed report from the police high-ups on the matter. ,Ruth Stephen, addressing the PML-N, in her tweet had said: “A land mafia, backed by a selected MP of yours is bent upon grabbing our church land in @CMShehbaz constituency. They’ve been framing false cases against us, making a judicial suit as a criminal one”. ,The sources in police said that the CM had sought a report on the case. ,Ms Ruth’s family is in civil litigation to get possession of five kanal disputed land. She alleged that MPA Mary Gill has been backing her father, Raja Nathaniel Gill, to implicate her (Ruth’s) family in many criminal cases to grab the disputed land in Youhanabad which was obtained for a church. ,“Nathaniel Gill, a senior lawyer by profession, misused his authority, bribed Nishtar Colony police and lodged four criminal cases against my family members,” Abraham Stephen, Ruth’s brother, told Dawn on Tuesday. ,He said three FIRs were registered in 2017 and another some three weeks back with the Nishtar Colony Police Station. He lamented the police nominated his elderly father, Stephen Illyas, and 19-year-old brother Joshua Stephen, an A level student, in these cases. ,“I am an engineer by profession and Mr Nathanial Gill also lodged a criminal case against me with the same police station,” Mr Abraham said, adding that his rival had filed over 20 applications against them with the police. ,The first three FIRs were registered against him and his other family members under the Telegraph Act and the last one for setting Nathaniel’s car on fire, Abraham gave details. He alleged that all the applications were filed on the letter head of MPA Marry Gill and purpose was to harass him and his family to force them to withdraw the case from the civil court. ,He complained that his family had suffered a lot due to police’s rude behaviour during the last couple of years, adding that his father had severe heart and paralysis attacks due to the harassment. ,Abraham, however, said he and his family got a little bit relief after the chief minister took notice of his sister’s tweet on Monday. ,Divisional SP Faisal Shahzad called the both the parties and after giving sympathetic hearing barred the local police from lodging further any case against his family. ,MPA Mary Gill strongly denied the allegation leveled against her, saying: “The Stephen family had tactfully dragged me in the case being political leader. ,“I am an MPA from the ruling party and it is very easy to target me. It is matter of fact that Nathanial Gill is my father but I have nothing to do with the case of disputed land in question,” she went on saying. ,Ms Gill said neither her letterhead was used to lodge cases against Mr Stephen and his family nor would she allow anyone to misuse it. ,She suggested to the Stephen family to avoid politicising the ‘local dispute’. ,Mr Nathanial Gill’s stance complicated the matter when he claimed that the disputed land was not meant for the church. ,“The Stephen family members are deliberately twisting the facts by giving the matter a religious colour to gain sympathies of the authorities as they fear that the judgment of the court is coming against them,” he said. ,Highlighting background perspective of the disputed land, Mr Nathaniel claimed the disputed piece of land was actually owned by some Muslim people of the same area. ,“It is matter of fact that it doesn’t belong to any of Christians or reserved for Church,” he said and added that originally the disputed land measuring total 66 marla was owned by one Muhammad Abdul Rehman. ,Out of which, Mr Rehman sold out 19 marla to a local Muslim man, Salim Amir, settled in America, 10 marla each to Nargis Siddique and May Simen and one kanal and seven marla to an elderly lady, Kalli Bibi. ,“Later I purchased three kanal and six marla piece of land from Kalli Bibi in 1995,” Mr Nathanial added. ,As the land was located adjacent to the house of Mr Stephen, he illegally encroached on it a couple of years back at night, raising walls, putting up a gate and displaying on it the symbol of crucifixion, Nathanial alleged. ,His rival also displayed a board ‘Convention Centre and Assembly of God’ giving it a religious colour, issuing a threat to the Muslim owners that he would bring the matter to the authorities for ‘an attempt to grab Church property’. ,“I went into the litigation and after fighting the case for two years, got possession of the land through the bailiff,” Mr Nathanial said. ,He denied the allegation of using influence of the police to implicate his rival family in any cases. ,Model Town Division SP (Operations) Faisal Shahzad rejected the allegation leveled by the Stephen family against the police saying the accused had been declared guilty of charges in three out of the four cases lodged against them. ,He said in the last case of setting car on fire, the two local residents had submitted an affidavit that they had witnessed Stephen family members while committing the crime. ,“I called both the families on Monday, heard their respective claims and took a decision to resolve the issue,” Mr Shahzad said. ,He said both the parties had agreed to refer the matter to ‘alternate dispute resolution’ for a permanent solution. ,An important meeting to this effect has been called within a couple of days to reach a resolution, the SP said.",2018-05-02,https://www.dawn.com/news/1405091/cm-takes-notice-of-tweet-against-mpa,"CM takes notice of tweet against MPA

Even an allowance announced by the prime minister was not being given to the officials. ,Dealing with terrorism is a very risky job and needs a lot of courage, the officer said, adding the morale of the officials should be kept high which can only be possible with better facilities, appreciation and perks and privileges. ,Officials of the Punjab Counter-Terrorism Department are  getting a CTD allowance of Rs50,000. On other the hand, the prime minister had announced a CTF allowance of Rs7,490 for the officials of the force in the capital. ,Initially, the Finance Division raised technical objections over the allowance but later agreed to release it. But at the same time, the Finance Division deducted the special allowance of Rs5,290 from the salaries of the officials. ,The special allowance was being given to officials and officers of the police all over the country for the last couple of years. ,Moreover, the officials of the CTF are getting the basic pay of 2011 even though they joined the force in 2017, the officer stated. ,The matter was brought in the knowledge of the interior minister during his visit to the Police Lines Headquarters in March. The minister promised to resolve the issue and asked the police to approach him in writing. ,A recent letter from the SSP addressed to the ministry and the inspector general of the police (IGP) stated that in the backdrop of terrorist attacks across the country the specialised force had been constituted under the name of Rapid Response Force (RRF) which was now working as the CTF. The force was constituted by the prime minister on the pattern of the CTD Punjab. ,The prime minister approved one additional pay for the officer/officials of the force as an allowance on the recommendations of the finance division. However, so far this allowance has not been granted due to conflicting interpretations of the prime minister’s summary dated Nov 18, 2015. Now after two years of correspondence, the allowance has been approved at the level of admissibility as on June 30, 2015, which comes out to be nearly Rs2,200 per month per constable. ,IGP Dr Sultan Azam Temuri could not be contacted for comments.",2018-05-02,https://www.dawn.com/news/1405059/newly-formed-ctf-at-verge-of-collapse,"Newly-formed CTF at verge of collapse

Instead, they were offered national verification card (NVC), popularly known as “embassy card” which means the Rohingya are illegal migrants from Bangladesh.,Nurul, the only son of his parents, still kept his hope alive although he, like all other Rohingyas, faced restrictions on movement and right to property. They also had to pay officials for marriage and even burials.,Then came the military crackdowns in 2012 and 2016 following ethnic conflicts, making life more difficult.,“I could not stay anymore when my house was burnt like those of many others. We fled to Bangladesh to save our lives,” Nurul, father of five children, told The Daily Star, sitting along a road in Kutupalong Friday.,The mega camp in Kutupalong became the world’s largest refugee camp in recent times after some 700,000 Rohingya fled the latest military offensive in August last year.,In the earlier waves in 1978 and 1991-92, hundreds of thousands of this persecuted minority community fled, but most of them returned home in the hope of better days. However, many of them had to flee to Bangladesh again and again.,In all, more than 1.1 million Rohingya now live in Bangladesh.,Their life and living conditions in Myanmar is reflected in the 13-point demand they prepared for their repatriation as the UNSC visits the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar.,The demands include closing the camps for internally displaced people (IDP); ensure presence of international security forces in Rakhine for safety; and restoration of citizenship for the Rohingya people.,Myanmar signed a repatriation deal with Bangladesh amid global pressure in November last year, but the repatriation is yet to begin.,The UN and other rights bodies say the situation in Rakhine is still “extremely concerning” and is not conducive for the safe and dignified return of the Rohingya.,Nurul Amin does not like the refugee life in the squalid camp and wants to return to Maundaw, but he cannot trust Myanmar anymore. The Myanmar authorities say Rohingya have to first apply for the NVC, which is a gateway to citizenship.,During a recent visit to Bangladesh, Dr Aung Tun Thet, chief coordinator of Myanmar’s Union Enterprise for Humanitarian Assistance, Resettlement and Development in Rakhine, said, “If you go through it [NVC], you are sure of citizenship.”,He admitted in the past it was not easy for those having NVCs to move freely. The refugees say the small number of Rohingya who took NVCs in exchange for money could move within a neighbourhood. To move from one locality to another, they have to pay much higher.,Tun Thet said, “Now, with NVCs, people [Rohingya] can move freely within their own township in Rakhine. Slowly as you build trust, then you would be eligible to have National Registration Card.”,Myanmar’s social welfare minister U Win Myat Aye, after a visit to Cox’s Bazar early April, said that the Rohingya were ill-informed about the NVC.,At a press conference in Yangon, upon return from Bangladesh, he stressed that NVC holders were eligible for citizenship after five months.,Nurul, however, said Myanmar did not keep its promise of granting citizenship in the past.,“How can we trust Myanmar government?” he said, reflecting the frustration of any Rohingya men and women in the camps in Cox’s Bazar.,Syed Alam, 20, said he wants to go back to his motherland as soon as possible as a Rohingya, not as an illegal migrant from Bangladesh.,Alam, who studied up to class 10, the highest level of education any Rohingya can obtain in Rakhine, said the Myanmar authorities were deceiving the Rohingya in the name of repatriation.,“Having NVC means we are illegal migrants from Bangladesh. It is a tragedy that we will be treated as illegal migrants in our motherland. If one takes the card, he has to stay in the camp for the rest of his life,” he added.,Abdul Kader, 60, another Rohingya, said the lives of those who took embassy cards in Rakhine were simply ruined.,“They never got citizenship cards. They also could not own property worth more than TK 30,000. So you understand the scenario,” he told this correspondent, sitting at a shop at a crowded Rohingya market in Kutupalong.,The Rohingya cannot even rear any chicken, cow or goat without permission of the military, he claimed.,“They [army] visit once a month. If they find any increase in number of domestic animals, the Rohingya have to pay for that. Even if anyone wants to marry, they have to pay. Relatives also have to pay the military to bury their dead,” he claimed.,“If the Myanmar government gives us citizenship card, we will return to Myanmar immediately,” said Mohammad Yusuf, who fled to Bangladesh along with his five sons and four daughters on October 9 from Akyab in Rakhine where he owns 3.5 acres of land.,“Having an ’embassy card’ means you are a Bangalee and entered Myanmar illegally. Why should we take that card? Are we Bangalees? If we take NVC cards, we will never be given citizenship. We will have to return again,” Yusuf said.,Noor Mohammad, a Rohingya in Kutupalong, said the Myanmar authorities offered him NVC card for the last 15 years, but he refused. He said Hindus and Buddhists, who crossed the border to Myanmar, got the nationality cards immediately, but not the Rohingya Muslims.,“If they can get nationality cards, why shouldn’t we? Why should we be foreigners in our motherland?”,Razia Sultana, a Rohingya lawyer and activist, said the Rohingya were denied government jobs, higher education, healthcare and freedom of movement since 1982.,“We live like illegal foreigners in a land where we lived for generations.

The violations included killing of journalists, abductions, kidnappings, physical attacks and injuries, arrests, threats and specific cases of harassment,” it said.,The year saw at least five working journalists as 'killed for their work"", including Abdul Razzaq, correspondent for , channel in Kasur; Bakshish Elahi, the bureau chief of , in Haripur; Haroon Khan, a reporter with , and a stringer for , in Swabi; Anjum Muneer Raja, a sub-editor with Urdu daily , in Rawalpindi; and Zeeshan Ashraf, correspondent for , daily in Sambrial.,The FN report adds that 35 per cent of the (55 out of 157) cases were recorded in the federal capital Islamabad, making it the most dangerous place to practice journalism in the country. ,The most targeted medium remained TV with 85 cases recorded against journalists associated with it compared to print, radio and internet.,After Islamabad, other areas found dangerous for journalists were Punjab the second worst with 17% of the violations (26 cases), followed closely by Sindh with 16% (25 cases), Balochistan with 14% (22 cases) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 10% (16 cases). The Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) documented the least number of overall violations at 8% of the total with 13 out of 157 cases.,The FN report points to the state, and its agencies and functionaries, as the most serious threat actors targeting media in 39 per cent of the incidents, as compared to other actors such as militant groups, political parties, religious groups and criminals.

"May 02, 2018","			,BANNERS are up and political leaders are out at the hustings. It is now the season of rallies and shifting alliances as the countdown to the 2018 general elections has begun amidst deepening uncertainties. Given such an intensely polarised political atmosphere, the run-up to the polls has never been trickier. ,There are still many hurdles to cross on the way to what is believed to be the most critical vote that would determine the future course of politics in this country. The outcome is never easy to predict given the volatility of our political landscape; it is much more complicated now with other factors influencing the process. ,Principles and ideology have never been virtues in Pakistan’s electoral politics. This is clearly evident, with so-called electables ready to ditch their parties for better prospects. At the other end, political parties are only too eager to embrace the turncoats. Not surprisingly, the exodus is mostly taking place from the ranks of the ruling PML-N which seems to have come under greater pressure following the life ban on Nawaz Sharif’s holding public office. ,Another top PML-N leader bit the dust as the Islamabad High Court last week , for perjury and hiding his employment and assets abroad. Predictably, the ruling has added to the controversy about the use of constitutional Articles 62 and 63 to disqualify political leaders. Although the charges against the former foreign minister seem much more substantive, the ban is being depicted by party supporters as yet another example of victimisation and selective judicial action. ,Previously a movement for change that inspired voters, the PTI seems to have lost momentum.,Meanwhile, the former prime minister faces possible conviction by an ,. While Nawaz Sharif appears determined to fight back, it is not clear how many senior party leaders and lawmakers would stand by him when it comes to the crunch. Given the perception that the security establishment would not let Sharif back in saddle and that there are no signs of the judiciary relenting, the cracks in the party have widened. The desertion of some half a dozen PML-N lawmakers mainly from south Punjab is seen by many as just the beginning of the opening of the floodgates.   ,It is evident that the PML-N would go into the election campaign playing the victim card and on the slogan of ‘giving respect to the vote’. However phony this mantra may sound, it has helped Sharif maintain his mass popular support base in Punjab. But it may not be enough for the party to sweep the polls as the noose tightens around it. The disqualification of Khawaja Asif has dealt a serious political blow to the PML-N and intensified the demoralisation within its ranks. ,There are conflicting views on the political fallout of the expected conviction of the former prime minister and members of his family on the eve of the elections. While some believe that it could reinforce a sympathy wave for Sharif, others think it could deepen the cracks within the party. Whatever the situation, it will cast a long shadow on the entire election process, adding to the prevailing uncertainty. ,It is evident that Punjab will be the main electoral battleground where the PML-N is being challenged by the PTI. Given its formidable mass base and capacity to challenge the incumbent, it is not surprising that most defectors seek to jump on Imran Khan’s bandwagon. The perception of tacit support by the establishment makes the party more attractive to the electables and opportunists. The virtual annihilation of the PPP in Punjab has also given a boost to the PTI. ,Last week, the PTI launched its election campaign with an ,, the citadel of Sharif’s political power. Imran Khan has also announced an 11-point charter of reform that his party pledges to undertake if it comes to power. Interestingly, the new slogan of ‘one Pakistan’ has replaced the old one of ‘naya Pakistan’.  ,It is uncertain whether this rather ambiguous slogan could become a rallying point for the electorate. The change of slogan also signifies the changing complexion of the party. Previously a movement for change that inspired voters — particularly the youth — in 2013, the PTI seems to have lost momentum with the mass induction of defectors from other parties, many of them with dubious records. ,This transformation has affected the PTI’s image as a party of change. Nevertheless, with a large number of so-called electables in its ranks, the party leadership appears confident it has a better chance of winning the elections. It is a bargain Imran Khan perhaps struck to reach the highest pedestal of power. ,One can also argue that the PTI has never been an ideological party and had no clear plan to take the country forward on the path of progress. But even for a reform agenda, it needs some principled people around. The party’s 11-point charter indicates a greater emphasis on the development of human infrastructure such as education, health and environment in sharp contrast to the PML-N’s obsession with motorways and other grand infrastructural projects. ,However positive the charter may appear, the real challenge arises when it is time to deliver on the promises. Notwithstanding all good intentions, there is a need for capacity to implement the reform agenda. The experience of the PTI’s five-year rule in KP has not been exemplary except for police reform and some improvement in the education and health sectors. ,Of course, the PPP is not out of the contest despite its minimal presence in Punjab. Its power base in Sindh has remained unchallenged. In the event of a hung parliament, it can emerge as a power broker. Unlike the two other parties, the PPP does not seem to have any new election message. It still seeks to appeal to the voters on the Bhutto legacy; that will surely not work in any other province. The weakening of the PPP has left a huge gap in national politics that is hard to fill. So it’s back to the hustings despite the political 
uncertainty gripping the country. , ",2018-05-02,https://www.dawn.com/news/1405141/back-to-the-hustings,"Back to the hustings

Sixteen participants who suffered from PTSD when they joined the trial no longer met the criteria for diagnosis.,The findings suggest this ""novel approach to pharmacotherapy"" may help accelerate patient treatment by combining psychotherapy with a fast-acting drug ""administered only a few times at monthly intervals,"" said the team.,But this did not mean that people suffering from a psychiatric disorder should rush out in search of ecstasy — an illegal drug — in the hopes it will make them feel better, said the team.,MDMA treatment should only be done hand in hand with psychotherapy under the supervision of a qualified medical professional.,During the trial, 85 ""adverse events"" — including anxiety, headaches, fatigue, and insomnia — were reported by 20 trial participants.

"May 02, 2018","Pakistan bowling coach Azhar Mahmood “wants more” from Mohammad Amir, a challenge he believes the pacer will rise to in upcoming Test matches against Ireland and England. ,Amir was the hottest property in world cricket after bursting on the scene as a teenager in 2009. ,He was soon earning comparisons with fellow Pakistan left-arm fast bowler Wasim Akram, with Wasim himself declaring Amir a better bowler than he had been at the same age. ,At 18, Amir was the youngest bowler to have reached the landmark of 50 Test wickets. ,His first 14 matches in the five-day game saw him take 51 wickets at just a fraction over 23 apiece — figures that had Amir on course to be an all-time great. ,But Amir's world was turned upside down in 2010 when he and Mohammad Asif became involved in a spot-fixing scandal after deliberately bowling no-balls during the Lord's Test against England at the behest of then Pakistan captain Salman Butt. ,In 2011 Amir was given a five-year ban by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and sentenced to six months in jail by an English court. ,Amir , in 2016 but his 16 Tests since his comeback have yielded 44 wickets at a relatively expensive 37.25. ,“We want more from Amir, as bowling coach I want more from Amir,” Mahmood told , after the pacer took one wicket for 45 runs in 15 overs during Pakistan's drawn tour opener against Kent at Canterbury on Tuesday. ,“If you see his record since he came back it's not great, but he was coming back after five years out,” the former Pakistan all-rounder added. “He needs to take a bit more responsibility and get more wickets for us. ,“If he's the leader of this attack, he needs to show us a bit more. ,“I'm sure he will do that and that's what we want from him.” Given his lengthy absence it is unsurprising that the now 26-year-old Amir has not quite scaled the heights he reached earlier in his career. ,Nevertheless, there have been some memorable moments since his return, with Amir taking a superb three for 16 in six overs as Pakistan thrashed arch-rivals India by 180 runs in the final of last year's Champions Trophy one-day tournament at The Oval. ,Amir's figures against Kent on a cool, if sunny, day were nothing like as spectacular. ,This, however, was a warm-up match, with Pakistan next facing Northamptonshire before providing the opposition for Ireland's inaugural Test and then returning to England for a two-Test series. ,And one delivery from Amir, who served part of his prison sentence in Canterbury jail, stood out on Tuesday when he demolished the stumps of Alex Blake with a late-swinging yorker. ,It certainly caught the admiring attention of Kent assistant coach Allan Donald, the former South Africa fast bowler. ,“When I saw this kid a few years ago, he's one of the most skilful that's going around,” Donald said. ,“When you saw him knocking over those 'poles' that's exactly what you expect from him — so much skill, so much imagination and creativity to produce that sort of thing on flat pitches.” ,He added: “When it gets flat, you have to think out of the box and to see that happening was an eye-opener.” ,Meanwhile Donald predicted Pakistan, whose last Test series in England ended in a highly creditable 2-2 draw in 2016, would impress again this year. ,“There are some seriously good players in this Pakistan team,” he said. ,“I think it's going to be a great series — I hope it warms up for them though.”",2018-05-02,https://www.dawn.com/news/1405182/azhar-mahmood-adamant-pakistan-want-more-from-amir,"Azhar Mahmood adamant Pakistan 'want more' from Amir

None,"I’ve always been fascinated by the desert. The idea of a giant land of distant horizons, framed by a flawless canopy of blue sky, and complete silence. ,In my mind, being in a desert is like existing in a vacuum — no beginning, no end, and nothing around but space. ,A perfect, silent void. ,Few people appreciate the sheer beauty of a desert — far from the barren wastelands that we imagine them to be, they are dramatic, almost spiritual places, filled with life.,Being from Australia, I had experienced deserts long before visiting Pakistan. My native country, an entire continent, is filled with deserts which in some cases stretch thousands of kilometres to the seashore. ,I’ve flown over them countless times, and even driven through them. But I had never stayed any length of time in a desert — until now.,It was a few weeks ago that I received an invitation to stay on a friend’s relative’s farm in Hyderabad Thal, the desert west of Jhang in western Punjab. ,My friend Ali and I left Lahore in the middle of the night, and arrived at the desert just after the ringing of the , call to prayer — a perfect time to witness the sunrise. ,			,A giant tangerine sphere rose in the distance, bathing the surroundings in an atomic crimson hue — an otherworldly spectacle which seemed to greet us to the place which would be our home for the next few days.,Far from being desolate, the desert in Hyderabad Thal is lush green in February and March — this land is used for the cultivation of green chickpeas (,), and the squat plants' elastic branches and chubby little fruits jiggle in the desert breeze as far as the eye can see. ,The sea of green is interrupted only by the odd sand dune, where the faded yellow sand occasionally rises up in undulating waves, reminding us of what lies beneath.,When the harvest is picked, the roots die off and the desert returns to its usual naked emptiness. ,			,			,However the desert is far from dead; as we walked from the drop-off point towards the farmhouse, we spotted tracks in the sand; tiny scoop shapes that stood as evidence to the existence of insects and birds in the vicinity. ,My friend, a local, and I tried to imagine what could have produced the footprints; a sparrow, a small lizard, a scorpion, perhaps? ,What was clear was that while the animals that made it were long gone, the desert around us was teeming with life.,The days we spent at the , were long, dry, sweet and mesmeric. In March, the heat hadn’t yet built, and respite from the sun’s rays could be found under the boughs of a grand old banyan tree. ,We spent hours lolling about on ,, eating , picked straight off a tree across the yard. ,Lying on the string beds with only the sun’s position to indicate time, I felt that my life itself was slowing down. ,With no cellphone signal, no internet, little electricity to speak of, and no form of entertainment besides our own creative minds, I detected a gentle yet pleasant decalibrating of my sense of time.,With the sun’s migration from one side of the sky to the other, we moved the , to follow the shade. ,			,At one point, we ended up at a roll of sand next to a row of chickpea plants. A few small birds darted about in the greenery just metres away, diving and swooping at breakneck speed. ,The slightest movement by either of us would send them shooting off in a different direction, only to flitter back moments later. ,Laying on my stomach, I dragged myself lazily to the edge of the , and stretched my chin over the edge. I was now looking straight down at the powdery, sandy earth, and was amazed by what I saw. ,Scores of insects were marching beneath the , into the field of crops, each leaving behind their distinctive footprints. ,Ants, both tiny and large, something which resembled a crab in its sideways gait, tiny spiders... they were all on the move to the shady green microforest, possibly in the hope of finding cover from the birds above.,			,The other thing that strikes you about the desert is the sense of sheer quiet. Nowhere is the phrase 'deafening silence' more apt. ,So expansive is the sky, so distant the edge of the earth, so clear the visage, and so subtly alive the surroundings that it’s almost overwhelming. ,In such a situation one is forced to appreciate the humbling truth of how small one truly is in the grand scheme of things; for the thoughtful, it could inspire them to inner dialogue; for the uninitiated it could be simply terrifying.,To get some groceries for dinner, we would ride a motorbike 10 kilometres to the nearest town. The trail through the desert was lonely — the whole time we didn’t pass another soul, bar the odd snake which slithered across the path, or guard dog from a nearby farm which would bark at us until we were out of sight. ,			,			,Somewhere out there, in the middle of nowhere, we saw what looked like a mud brick building in the sand hills. Ali rode towards it to investigate; upon closer inspection it was a tiny mosque. ,""Why would they build a mosque out here?"" I asked. ,""For travellers. People travelling on foot,"" he replied. ,In all my hours indulgently lost on the ,, wondering dreamily about the enormity of it all, I had forgotten that, in fact, humans had, for millennia, conquered the desert by foot. ,Once again, but in a very different sense, I was struck by how small I was in this land of might and extreme. I kicked off my Peshawari , and sank my feet into the soft, soft sand. ,Beneath, the surface was cold, a sea of cool earth that hadn’t seen the heat of the day. The tiny grains trickled in between my toes, sensually massaging the soles of my feet, and I lay back in the field, staring at the milky blue sky. ,The sun was getting low in the sky, and I was partially shielded from its rays by a sand dune. An ethereal glow enveloped the remains of the day.,			,Turning around, we traced our tyre marks back through the sand to the main trail. We had just made it back to the trail when day began to turn to night, and as luck would have it, our bike suffered a punctured tyre. ,We parked the bike for a bit, and sat down to watch the sunset. The blazing sun, so blindingly white hot just a few hours earlier, had once again turned an inflamed red, before sinking behind the sand hills. ,The day’s azure canopy above was flushed with an iridescent indigo, shimmering with the lights of a thousand stars. ,With no other option, we walked back the last few kilometres to the farm, pushing the bike as we went. ,It was tough, the sand slipping beneath our feet and the bike’s wheels, but nothing compared to the feat of crossing the desert by day; the thought of thirsty nomads arriving at the mosque, parking their droves outside and taking refuge kept recurring in my mind. ,			,We arrived at the ,, and our , had been dragged to the top of the nearest sand hill. Shaking the dust off our feet, we reclined on the beds and stared at the universe above. ,This time, however, the desert wasn’t silent, but alive with the sound of a million beings which had come back to life, singing back to us the stories of the day which we had witnessed. ,Later still, we slept, our thick blankets wrapping us away from the cold of the night, and as we dreamt beneath the heavens, the theatre of the desert unfolded around us.",2018-05-02,https://www.dawn.com/news/1405171/an-odyssey-in-the-thal-desert,"An odyssey in the Thal desert

"May 02, 2018","For most people, weekends are synonymous with gluttony. And I'm no different. ,But last week, I decided to try something different from my usual weekend choices and placed an order at ,, a Thai food take-out and delivery joint that I discovered randomly through Facebook, which brands itself as low-cal and healthy. ,I thought to myself: a Thai meal should be healthier than junk food and more flavourful than a salad, right? Did Thaigrr satisfy the picky eater in me? Let's find out. ,Judging from their logo and Facebook content, the name Thaigrr comes from 'tiger', which connotes the eatery’s promise to deliver 'furiously good food'.,Located in Phase 2, the business operates much like Golden Dragon.,			,When I rang up Thaigrr, the person on call offered to send me a menu... on WhatsApp. While that's not how I usually like to place my order, I sent a list of foods I wanted in a single reply.,The food arrived piping hot after the promised 45 minutes but I was disappointed to learn that I paid a whopping Rs300 for delivery. The server didn't mention a break-up of the food prices or delivery charges at any point during our entire conversation, so I didn't see that coming. ,Considering Thaigrr is located 15 minutes away from my house, I'm fairly certain I could’ve Careem-ed to the joint, picked up my food and paid a smaller amount for the round trip. Sigh.,			,I wanted to try their Gai Thod (deep fried chicken drumsticks) but they never arrived in the delivery because they ran out...,I hoped the mains would make up for the disappointment, but that wasn't the case.,			,Let's start with their Khao Pad, which is Thai stir-fried rice that comes with your choice of protein (I opted for chicken).,Thai stir fried rice are sticky, I get it. But these were a tad too chewy for my liking. ,			,I appreciated how the rice was packed with protein - eggs and chicken - but the overall taste of the veggies, rice and seasoning together fell flat. The Khao Pad lost major points for flavour. I feel the seasoning to rice ratio was off, which is why it tasted bland.,Also, the restaurant didn't mention serving sizes or options of ordering family servings anywhere on the menu or over the phone. This was an inconvenience because I ended up ordering less than I should have. ,			,I quite enjoy Thai curries (particularly red curries), so I ordered their Kaeng Phet, which is the Thai red curry in beef. What I sadly ended up with was a curry way too runny for Thai standards and layered with too much oil that gave off a desi feel. So much for my low-cal eating plans.,The dish looked far from healthy and the after-taste was not pleasant. ,As much as I wanted to, I couldn’t judge the meat in the curry too well. The meat cuts were bite-sized but some pieces were chewier than the others. ,For me, this dish was also a no.,			,If there’s anything that saved the day, it was their stir-fried Thai noodles, Yum Mama.,Mama is to Thai people what Maggi is to us desis. The noodles held a texture similar to ramen noodles and thankfully were loaded with crunchy veggies like celery, tomatoes, onions, and chillies with chicken. They could have gone easy on the onions and tomatoes, though. ,			,Strangely, the noodles had a funny odour (no, not like the authentic Thai food smell) but the seasoning had the right kick of flavour; a balanced blend of sweet and spicy. I'd say they were pretty close to authentic Thai stir fried noodles.,I ordered about three not-so-sufficient servings of food items and ended up paying Rs1770 (including a crazy Rs300 delivery charge). Their Yum Mama or stir-fried egg noodles were Rs350 plus tax, Khao Pad stir-fried rice in chicken, Rs400 plus tax and their Kaeng Ehet Thai Red Curry in beef, Rs550 plus tax.,: Thaiggr's delivery time was spot-on; the food arrived piping hot and within the time promised, without any confusions about location or multiple calls. The packaging was well done, no dripping, spillage or oily business here.,: placing the order via WhatsApp... they need to set up a better ordering system; prices are high considering their small serving sizes. The food (particularly the curry and rice) isn't really worth re-ordering for me.,I believe a take-out food business only has its food's taste to bank on and Thaigrr needs to work on that.,Considering how competitive the food industry is right now, Thaigrr really needs to pull up its socks. I understand it takes newbies a bit of time to transform into full-sized, functional businesses but food and taste are things you need to sort before you launch.",2018-05-02,https://images.dawn.com/news/1179954/is-thaigrr-the-answer-to-authentic-thai-food-delivery-in-karachi,"Is Thaigrr the answer to authentic Thai food delivery in Karachi?

They deserve that opportunity.” ,Sutherland added that he felt for the players, whose reputations have been trashed. ,“I feel forgiveness for all of them. I feel sympathy for them and I want to see them all come back and play their best cricket. I believe they all can,” he said. “Part of the design within the sanctions was to allow them to stay connected with the game. ,“I also see part of our role is to support them with their state associations and their clubs, to help them stay hungry and come back and play their best cricket.” ,Cricket Australia on Tuesday appointed an ethics guru to review the sport's culture in the wake of the scandal to ensure there is never a repeat. ,It will run in tandem with a separate probe announced last month into player behaviour.",2018-05-02,https://www.dawn.com/news/1405190/warners-international-career-not-over-yet-cricket-australia-ceo,"Warner's international career not over yet: Cricket Australia CEO

"May 01, 2018","WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump hasn’t decided whether to extend relief for allied nations from US steel and aluminium tariffs, creating uncertainty in global metals markets with temporary exemptions set to expire in less than 24 hours. ,“The president has not made any decision yet,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business Network in an interview that aired Monday, when asked about extending exemptions to trading partners.,“We’ve been having lots of discussions internally, we’ve been having lots of discussions with our counterparts,” he said, adding: “We’re addressing these issues real time.”,Mnuchin’s comments were similar to those of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who said late Saturday that the White House will announce its decision on tariffs right before the May 1 deadline.,Trump last month imposed 25 per cent tariffs on steel imports and 10pc on aluminium. But he gave temporary reprieves to Aus­tralia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Mexico and South Korea, and directed US Trade Representative Robert Ligh­t­­hizer to handle negotiations with countries seeking exemptions.,So far, South Korea is the only nation to be spared from the duties, though nations including France and Germany have been pushing for the EU to be excluded.,“The president gave us time to address these issues and the president is going to make a decision,” Mnuchin said. “I expect that there will be a decision quickly.”,Trump’s embrace of tariffs this year has roiled financial markets and sparked fears of a trade war that could undermine the broadest global upswing in years. The EU has threatened to retaliate with duties on iconic American goods such as Harley-Davidson motorcycles and Kentucky bourbon.,The steel decision comes days before Mnuchin and other senior members of Trump’s cabinet travel to China in search of a deal that would head off a brewing trade dispute between the world’s two-biggest economies. Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on as much as $150 billion in Chinese imports, while Beijing has vowed to respond with duties on everything from American soybeans to airplanes.,“We’re looking to have a very frank discussion on trade, on the issues of the trade imbalance,” Mnuchin said. “President Trump has been very clear for the last year that he’s very focused on the trade deficit, and we’re looking to correct that.”,The US had a $337bn trade deficit in goods and services with China last year. Trump has asked China to cut the gap by $100bn and open up the Asian nation’s markets to American products such as cars. But Chinese officials will refuse to discuss the $100bn demand at talks in Beijing this week, the New York Times reported, citing unidentified people.,In exchange for a permanent exemption from the metals tariffs, the Trump administration is pushing countries to accept quotas on the amount of steel and aluminium they export to the US. South Korea accepted a quota of 70pc of the average of its steel exports to the US between 2015 and 2017, which can come in tariff-free.,The US Aluminium Association last week sent a letter asking Trump to grant exemptions to all “responsible” trade partners. But over the weekend, Century Alumi­nium Co.

"May 01, 2018","LONDON: After bouncing up, falling down and keeping investors on the edges of their seats, bitcoin may be maturing into a period of relatively boring stability, experts say.,A worldwide wave of regulation has led to a collapse in trading volumes. Cryptocurrency advertisements are disappearing from top internet pages, and bitcoin no longer dominates Google searches.,As investors try to figure out what bitcoin wants to be when it grows up, the best-known cryptocurrency is going through somewhat of an existential crisis.,“It needs a new narrative,” said Nicholas Colas, New York-based founder of investment research firm DataTrek. “There is every chance that if there is some sort of institutional involvement, there could be a move higher.” Bitcoin rallied 25 per cent in April after crashing 70pc from a high near $20,000 late last year.,The cryptocurrency landscape has indeed changed. Mom-and-pop investors who drove bitcoin’s skyrocket rise in 2017 have been pushed aside by government bans on trading, and replaced by cryptocurrency funds, wealthy individuals and established financial firms.,The bigger players can make bigger moves, but their trades are often obscured by screens on over-the-counter (OTC) brokerages and matching platforms.,They are also less likely to chase sudden swings in bitcoin’s value, being more interested in the potential of unproven but promising blockchain technology.,Average daily traded volumes across cryptocurrency exchanges fell to $9.1 billion in March and to $7.4bn in the first half of April, compared with almost $17bn in December, according to data compiled by crypto analysis website CryptoCompare.,Several exchanges saw their daily trading volumes drop by more than half between December and March, including Bitfinex, Poloniex, Coinbase and Bitstamp, the data shows.,Cryptocurrencies’ biggest-ever trading day was Dec. 22, when volumes topped $30bn, according to CryptoCompare.,On April 8, volume sagged to $4.6bn, the weakest day since last October, according to the data.,The theory that bigger institutions will make bitcoin markets less volatile and more liquid has grown as new OTC exchanges and platforms spring up, carrying names such as Circle, Octagon Strategy, Cumberland and Kraken.,Digital exchange Gemini’s new block trading product allows high-volume trades that will be invisible to other traders until the orders are filled.,Cumberland, one of the biggest block traders, has counterparties in more than 35 countries and quotes two-way prices in about 35 crypto assets.,Gatecoin, a Hong Kong-based crypto exchange, saw retail volumes plunge from peaks of $100 million a day last September, said Aure­lien Menant, its founder and chief executive.,But, he said, as institutional players enter the market, OTC trades hidden from view have pushed up overall volumes in a way that doesn’t show up in data. Gatecoin also operates an OTC platform.,Few institutions have gone public about their plans to trade cryptocurrencies, and many asset managers say they still aren’t sure the digital currency is more than a fad.,But a , survey this week found one in five financial institutions is considering trading cryptocurrencies in the next 12 months. Of those, 70pc said they planned to start trading in the next three to six months.,In the meantime, the price of bitcoin may be stabilising, at least on paper. The futures market shows bitcoin staying nearly flat — between $8,900 and $9,050 — until September.,Gatecoin’s Menant, however, is considerably more bullish. He reckons the currency might end the year above $100,000, but acknowledges that’s a gamble.,Joe Duncan, founder of Singapore-based Fintech firm Duncan Capital, expects to see retail investors return to trading as governments slowly relax their cryptocurrency rules.,“But bitcoin could still lose some market dominance,” Duncan said.,Thomas Lee, managing partner and co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors in New York, said the bitcoin market is languishing in a “purgatory” phase somewhere between a bear and a bull market. He predicted that could continue until at least September.,One issue is that although many of the big institutions are curious about how bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology could revolutionise the financial sector, bitcoin isn’t widely accepted as currency and has no intrinsic value.,That, and the currency’s intense volatility, make it challenging for investors to forecast a price.,Some analysts think bitcoin will retain a premium as a security, like gold, in the digital world, while other cryptocurrencies are used for commerce.,Others see it as just another asset.,“One of the reasons to own cryptocurrencies is because they are an effective hedge,” said Sam Doctor, a data analyst at New York-based Fundstrat, a research firm whose founder is a well-known bitcoin bull predicting large rises this year. “Until something happens to disprove that thesis, you aren’t looking to sell them so long as other asset classes are falling.”",2018-05-01,https://www.dawn.com/news/1404862/bitcoin-frenzy-settles-down-as-big-players-muscle-into-market,"Bitcoin frenzy settles down as big players muscle into market

It’s difficult to give an exact figure. It will depend, but the loss of some seats is certain,” said Bakawan.,“For the Kurds, the city of Kirkuk is not only a source of oil, but also a major population centre in the electoral sense,” Bakawan added.,The loss of Kirkuk is a blow, acknowledged the KDP’s Kuran.,“In contrast to the 2014 elections, there will be no participation in the Kurdish territories outside the autonomous region, in the absence of Kurdish security forces to protect our voters,” he said.,In yet another setback for Kurdish parties, this will be the first time Kurds appear on candidate lists fielded by other ethnic blocs in their home region.,The most striking example is Mustafa Sheikh Kawa, grandson of Sheikh Mahmud Hafid Barzinji, who fought British occupation and set up a Kurdish state between 1920 and 1922.,Kawa is running as a candidate for a bloc led by Shia chief Amar al-Hakim.,“It’s an Iraqi list,” said Saed Hisa Barzinji, an associate of Kawa. “Our aim is to serve the people of Kurdistan.”",2018-05-01,https://www.dawn.com/news/1404914/divided-kurds-face-losses-in-iraqs-election,"Divided Kurds face losses in Iraq’s election

An official said the finance department had been verbally told about the budget decision but there was nothing on paper so far.,He said a formal approval was likely to be made to the decision later in the week.,However, sources said the government, which had called the assembly’s budget session on May 14, feared presenting the budget over its thin majority in the house.,Official claims finance dept verbally told about decision but formal consent later this week,They said initially, the government was tempted about making block allocations for the some sectors of its choice but it later backed off considering its thin majority in the house.,The PTI’s strength in the 124-member house came to 45 after the party chief, Imran Khan, named 20 party members as ‘sellers’ of votes in the recent Senate polls.,The PTI’s major ally, Jamaat Islami, has eight members in the house but it is likely to leave the government in few days to join the religious parties’ alliance, Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal.,The sources said in case the budget wasn’t passed by the assembly, the provincial government would collapse.,They also said Chief Minister Pervez Khattak had opposed the federal government’s decision to present the next year’s budget in the Council of Common Interest’s meeting on April 24.,“It’s becoming politically untenable for the PTI’s government to present the budget after opposing the federal government on the matter,” a source said. The chief minister’s spokesperson, MPA Shaukat Yousafzai, told Dawn that the government was against presenting the budget but it had decided to present the budget on the insistence of the opposition parties.,He said his party was against the current government presenting the annual development programme for the next fiscal and that it only wanted to present the administrative budget.

"May 01, 2018","PESHAWAR: The deaths of three children, who had died in Shaheen Muslim Town following administration of inactivated polio vaccine during the recently held anti-polio drive, created fear and panic among the local people. ,People in the area buried two children on Monday and alleged that vaccination carried out by health workers led to their deaths. They demanded action against those responsible for the deaths of the children. ,However, the health department has brushed aside the impression being created by the residents of Shaheen Muslim Town about deaths of three children.,Atif Rahman, the coordinator of Emergency Polio Centre, told a news conference that preliminary investigation suggested that two of the deaths occurred due to measles and gastroenteritis while the third one was being investigated by a committee, which would present its report within 48 hours.,The injectable vaccination has been administered to children in the high-risk union councils in Peshawar since April 23 to boost up children’s immunity against polio virus in the area. The virus has been in circulation in the area for the past five months. ,The local people claimed that the three children developed complications, which led to their deaths after vaccination. However, authorities concerned said that the matter was being investigated. ,Two children died last night and another on April 27. There was no indication that IPV had caused the deaths.,“The injectable vaccination, which is given to children for two years, was not administrated to one of the deceased, who happened to be one and half month old. Another child, who died at hospital, was treated for diarrhoea and gastroenteritis,” said Mr Rahman. He said that reaction from injection followed within 30 minutes while the children fell ill after hours and days.,He said that inquiry committee would investigate the deaths and would submit a report after which disciplinary action would be taken if anyone was found guilty. ,Mr Rahman told Dawn that IPV was administered to children towards the end of polio eradication effort and they were committed to ensure that vaccination was conducted smoothly and the children stayed safe.,He said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which saw one polio case last year, had not recorded any case in 2018 but still risked the vaccine-preventable childhood ailment because of recent testing of positive samples from Kohat and Bannu districts recently apart from Shaheen Muslim Town, Peshawar where environmental water sample had consistently been positive.,“Even if we don’t have case but virus is looming and vaccination is the only way to protect our children against disabilities. The campaign targeting 200,000 children is being carried out by trained workers and it is a proven fact that either of polio vaccination, oral or injectable, does not cause death,” said Mr Rahman. ,The local health professionals said that the area had sizeable number of refusal cases against vaccination due to misconceptions. They said that linking the deaths of children with immunisation could cause setback to the campaign. ,They also said that people were in the habit of getting compensations from government for deaths caused by dengue fever and they would try to get some monetary assistance for the losses of their near and dear ones in that case too. ,The health department paid Rs500, 000 for each dengue fever-related death in December last year. ,The anti-vaccination efforts by vested groups also propagate that it is an agenda of anti-Muslims to render the Muslims infertile and reduce their population. But such propaganda is losing steam and perpetrators look for occasions to build their case and convince the people to refuse vaccination at the cost of the children’s lives.,The programme is run through government money, loaned from Islamic Development Bank.

He said that frequent changes in the design of the project had given opportunities to the contractors, the ‘cronies’ of the party (PTI) leadership, to exploit the project funds.,JI chief’s adviser seeks SC order for inquiry into CM’s corruption, nepotism,Mr Qazi drew the attention of the Supreme Court chief justice towards the alleged corruption in Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organisation and insisted that the interference of a PTI leader had compelled the Pedo’s management to hire hundreds of officers against huge salary and perks and thus, compromising the department’s performance and financial strength.,He demanded investigation into the PTI government’s Billion Tree Tsunami afforestation project saying it has become controversial due to the false claims and exaggeration on the part of the party leadership.,JI chief’s adviser alleged that hundreds of party activists were given opportunity to make money through fake bills.,“The alleged corruption, nepotism and mismanagement have marred the KP Economic Zones Development and Management Company, which was established to develop special economic zones in the province for industrialisation. Hundreds of the relatives of PTI leadership were hired against huge salary but the performance of the department has so far been nil,” he said, adding that the party’s favourites drew more than Rs500 million in ‘safeties’ alone other than perks.,He said the government spent Rs34 billion on the construction of flood retaining wall along the Kabul River but no quantitative audit of the project was conducted.,“A large part of stones were simply dumped into the river by a ring of the chief minister’s near and dear ones, who were miraculously successful in securing bids,” he said.,Mr Qazi said financial scams had already been reported in the mining and minerals department and that a provincial minister had disclosed the nepotism and corruption of the chief minister in the mining sector. ,He said the chief minister had appointed his nephew, Zarak Khattak, as the executive engineer in the communication and works department in Nowshera district (CM’s hometown) and that most funds were siphoned off under his stewardship. ,He said that KP Ehtesab Commission didn’t act against Mr Khattak and that it had been functioning without head for few years.,He said the KPEC’s director general had resigned after leveling serious allegations against the CM.,When contacted, spokesman for the chief minister Shaukat Ali Yousafzai denied all allegations against Mr Khattak.,He wondered the JI leaders had seeing corruption in development projects after remaining quite satisfied with governance for more than four years.,“Qazi Luqman does not have a political career.

"May 01, 2018","			,AS the temperatures rise, election season creeps up on us. Two days after the budget was presented, the dull numbers game had been abandoned on Sunday night for jalsas, guessing games about the people present (another kind of a numbers game) and election promises galore across the country. ,From Karachi to Punjab to Mardan (leaving aside the one namaloom gathering), leaders put their best foot forward and reminded voters why their party was the only option. The PPP reached out to the people of Karachi while Imran Khan wooed the Lahoris. There was an MMA jalsa in Mardan, peopled mostly by bearded men (if the few glimpses on television were an accurate portrayal). However, the limited coverage of the religious alliance gathering simply reflects the unlikelihood of the MMA doing too well in the election. ,On the other hand, the coverage of the PPP in Karachi and the PTI in Lahore was wall to wall and mostly undisturbed by commentary and ads. After all, these were the two main opposition parties leading the charge against the reigning PML-N, as well as shoo-ins for provincial setups in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. ,From Karachi to Punjab to Mardan, leaders put their best foot forward.,But on Sunday night, both Imran Khan and Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari were not simply kicking off their election campaign but also reaching out to Pakistan’s two biggest cities, which for decades had looked elsewhere for leadership and representation — Karachi to the MQM and Lahore to the Muslim League-Nawaz (except for the Q rule from 2002 to 2008).,That both parties are able to do so, has more to do with the MQM and PML-N than the achievements of the PPP and PTI. ,The relentless operations in Karachi and Altaf Hussain’s run-ins with the establishment have weakened the MQM’s hold on the city. And the latest round of infighting within the MQM means the city may once again be ready to vote for others. Hence, the charm offensive by BBZ, who spoke about why the PPP had so far not been able to transform Karachi (the local government was in charge of Karachi, he argued) and how this would now change. Recounting what his party had done for Karachi, he reminded the crowds that his party was not a party of target killers and sector commanders.,Flanked by senior PPP leaders from Sindh (another reminder of how the party, once a zanjeer of the four provinces now has few faces left outside the province), BBZ also spoke of how he belonged to the third generation of Bhuttos in the service of the people and how the PPP had stood up against extremism at a time when few others were willing to do so. The party’s stand on extremism is the one strong message BBZ has consistently flaunted. ,Criticising the MQM, PTI and Imran Khan and even Shahbaz Sharif’s recent promises to the Karachiites, BBZ’s main message was of what he was not rather than what he may stand for. Unfortunately, this is exactly what this young man needs to address. ,Across the country, the PTI laid its claim to takht-i-Lahore. There is little doubt that the party has made inroads into the PML-N’s stronghold of Lahore (the election results of 2013 and nearly every by-election in Punjab since then illustrate this) but the PTI smells victory this time around because of the establishment’s machinations against the League and the disarray in the latter’s ranks. ,The sense of triumph in the PTI’s jalsa was palpable. Perhaps because, while the PPP can only hope to pick up a few seats in Karachi, the PML-N’s weakening gives the PTI hope of a shot at the centre. After all, the road to Islamabad runs through Punjab with its high number of National Assembly seats. ,Indeed, this was Khan’s and the PTI’s celebration of their journey since 1997; the dance of victory as an enemy lay vanquished (so what if the thousand cuts had been inflicted by other forces) and a formal announcement that it was laying claim to the throne. ,Hence, Khan, unlike BBZ, didn’t focus on the city he was he holding the jalsa in. Instead he gave his 11-point agenda. He provided a to-do list — though his speech could have been so much shorter and less ‘rambly’ — from more obvious items such as eradicating corruption to some which are not so frequently mentioned such as creating jobs by encouraging investment and improving the environment for business or boosting tourism.,The PTI’s message is criticised for aiming at the middle class, the party’s original constituency. But whether one likes it or not, it’s a message that resonates in Punjab and even beyond in a way that that of anti-extremism does not. ,Consider a new UNDP report on the youth coming out tomorrow, which lists the eight priorities of the young as: complete studies; get a job; change job; marry; have children; emigrate; buy a house; buy a car. And this list of priorities was compiled by way of having focus groups across the country and compiling the result. In other words, the researchers did not provide the options to the young. The young identified the priorities themselves. Extremism or militancy is not a concern for the young people; economic issues are. Is this why the PTI is seen as a party supported by the youth? ,This is what Khan is tapping into as does the PML-N. The PPP, with its poor governance record and reputation for corruption, just doesn’t appeal to the electorate in Punjab. BBZ needs to understand this and shape his party and his message accordingly.  ,Till he does so, Khan will remain the prime ministerial aspirant who was addressing Lahore but looking beyond the city’s horizons. The PPP, on the other hand, can have no such pretentions. Punjab is beyond its reach, no matter what Asif Ali Zardari says.,This is BBZ’s biggest challenge — drag his party into present-day Punjab, by not just challenging the N as Khan is doing but also coming up with a message as potent as ‘roti, kapra aur makaan’ once was. Till he does so, his party will not make a comeback in Punjab, whether or not he has his father by his side. ",2018-05-01,https://www.dawn.com/news/1404921/winning-over-punjab,"Winning over Punjab

"May 01, 2018","LAHORE: Chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq is upbeat about the chances of a young-looking Pakistan team defeating England on their home soil in the forthcoming two-Test series.,“Our team is quite capable of winning the Test series against England and the one-off Test against Ireland,” Inzamam said while talking to reporters here at the LCCA ground on Monday after distributing prizes among the cricketers of the teams which played the Muslim Gymkhana annual match.,Inzamam said though the playing conditions for Pakistan in England were tough, he had full confidence in the youngsters who — along with the senior pros — he reckoned could subdue England in the two-match rubber.,In a predominantly young 16-member Test squad, at least seven players are permanent players  of Pakistan’s T20 team; they include captain Sarfraz Ahmed, Fakhar Zaman, Babar Azam, Haris Sohail, Shadab Khan, Fahim Ashraf and Hasan Ali.,Interestingly, only Sarfraz, Azhar Ali, Asad Shafiq, Sami Aslam, Mohammad Amir and Rahat Ali are the ones in the 16-member touring party who have played Test matches in England in the past.,To a question, Inzamam, whose selection committee has not considered tainted players Asif and Salman Butt — both of whom had completed their ban imposed on them by the ICC in the 2010 spot-fixing case — for national selection despite their impressive show on domestic circuit, said future of no player had ended.,“I do not rule out return of Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif [to national team]. However having said this, our focus is on [talented] youngsters as we are looking at the future,” he said.,Justifying the selection committee’s decision of inducting a number of youngsters into national squad for the England and Ireland Tests, Inzamam said, “Whenever promising youngsters are tested in international competitions, we should not be afraid of defeat as this is the part of the game.”,The chief selector also denied the impression that the pool of players in his tenure had been reduced.,He said the decision to send the Pakistan squad to England much earlier before the start of the one-off Test against Ireland (May 11, Dublin) was taken so that the cricketers got appropriate time to adjust well to the playing conditions before the start of the Test matches. Pakistan’s Tests against England will be held from May 24-28 (Lord’s) and June 1-5 (Headingley).,Commenting on Pakistan crumbling to 168 all out in the ongoing four-day tour opener against Kent at Canterbury, the chief selector said the young players “take some time to adjust to hard playing conditions in England”. ,Responding to a query on whether picking just one wicket-keeper in captain Sarfraz Ahmed for the tour of Ireland and England where besides the three Tests Pakistan will also feature in a number of side matches, was the right decision, Inzamam simply said, “We will try to avoid any such bad happening with Sarfraz.”",2018-05-01,https://www.dawn.com/news/1404958/young-pakistan-team-can-overpower-england-inzamam,"Young Pakistan team can overpower England: Inzamam

There was a festive atmosphere for the second leg, which was supposed to be a mere formality.,But Real were surprised by Juventus from the start, quickly squandering their advantage by conceding twice in the first half and once after halftime.,The 12-time champions only escaped an embarrassing home elimination thanks to a controversial late penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo.,“What we have to do is go out and try to win the match,” Real coach Zinedine Zidane said. “That’s going to be our goal. We are not going to think too much about anything else. We will try to score as quickly as possible and win the match.”,Real also relinquished their lead against Bayern in the quarter-finals last season, when they also won 2-1 in Munich in the first leg.,A week later, Bayern sent the match into extra time. Ronaldo, who got both goals in the first leg and one in regulation in the second, scored twice in extra time to complete a hat trick and save Madrid from elimination.,“I don’t know how significant the first-leg advantage will be. We know what happened against Juventus and against Bayern last year,” Zidane said.,“We will need a huge performance. We will need to play like never before this year to be able to advance. We are prepared and we are going to give it all we’ve got to make it to the final.”,Sloppy defense was key for Real’s home struggles both against Juve and against Bayern last year. Real didn’t play poorly but couldn’t stop their opponents on the few chances they created. Against Juve, all three goals came when the Real defense failed to clear routine crosses into the area.,Bayern remember last year’s match well.,“I think they were floundering for every cross and for every long ball, so we know what we have to do,” Bayern striker Sandro Wagner said.,The defense could be a problem for Real again on Tuesday as right-back Dani Carvajal is out injured and Zidane has few options to replace him. Youngster Achraf Hakimi is Carvajal’s immediate substitute but he has not impressed this season.,Nacho Fernandez, a central defender who has played at right back on other occasions, is coming off an injury and it’s not clear if he will be available to play.,Zidane said he may consider using forward Lucas Vazquez in defence, as he did after Carvajal had to leave the first leg because of his injury.,Real captain Sergio Ramos, who used to play as a right-back, could also end up on the flank.,“It could be an option,” Ramos said. “I can adapt. It wouldn’t be a problem for me.”,Real are trying to win a third straight European title, and fourth in five seasons.

The tourists lost by seven wickets. ,Australia believe day-night Test cricket is the future of the sport and perhaps the only way to save the format despite boom television ratings and record crowds. ,But the powerful Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have so far resisted CA’s overtures. ,CA will play a pink-ball Test against Sri Lanka in Brisbane next year, but chief executive James Sutherland said he was still negotiating with India. ,“It is our preference that we play India in a day-night Test match in Adelaide, but we are still working through this detail and hope to have an answer on this in the coming weeks,” he said. ,Sutherland has been pushing hard at International Cricket Council level for the new Test Championship schedule to include day-night Tests, but the powerful BCCI has a big say in outcomes. ,CA confirmed Australia will face South Africa in a one-off Twenty20 International on Queensland’s Gold Coast, while the new Perth Stadium and Canberra’s Manuka Oval will both host Test cricket for the first time. But Hobart misses out. ,The international season starts on Nov 4 with the first of three ODIs against South Africa before the one-off T20 against the Proteas on the Gold Coast, which will be followed by three T20s against India preceding the start of the Test summer. ,“Our men’s international season structure changes slightly this summer, with one-day and T20 international matches against South Africa and India in November,” Sutherland said. ,Adelaide opens the Test series against India for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and second Test will be at the Perth Stadium in Burswood, across the Swan river from the city’s traditional Test venue, the WACA. ,The series then moves back to Melbourne and Sydney for the traditional Boxing Day and New Year’s showpiece games. ,The Gabba in Brisbane, which usually hosts the first Test of the Australian summer, has been relegated to the Jan 24-28 series-opener against Sri Lanka, who will tour the country for the first time in six years. ,Canberra’s Manuka Oval will then host its first Test match from Feb 1 when the home side meets Sri Lanka in their second and final fixture. ,India’s tour will kick off with a three-match Twenty20 International series in November after Australia start the home summer with four limited overs matches against South Africa. ,The hosts will also play India in three ODIs in January. ,The schedule, which will see Test cricket played in February for the first time in over 20 years, has been structured to avoid clashing with the domestic ‘Big Bash’ T20 competition, which has proved a bigger drawcard for local fans than some Test matches in recent seasons. ,“This will be a win for fans, with reduced overlap with the Big Bash,” Sutherland said. ,Australian cricket has been in turmoil since a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last month led to 12-month bans for Test captain Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. ,The sanctions mean Australia’s two leading batsmen will be unavailable for selection for the home summer. , , ,Oct 31: vs PM XI (Canberra). ,Nov 4: First ODI (Perth Stadium). ,Nov 9: Second ODI (Adelaide). ,Nov 11: Third ODI (Hobart). ,Nov 17: One-off T20 International (Gold Coast). , ,Nov 21: First T20 International (Brisbane). ,Nov 23: Second T20 International (Melbourne). ,Nov 25: Third T20 International (Sydney). ,Dec 6-10: First Test (Adelaide, D/N). ,Dec 14-18: Second Test (Perth Stadium). ,Dec 26-30: Third Test (Melbourne). ,Jan 3-7: Fourth Test (Sydney). ,Jan 12: First ODI (Sydney). ,Jan 15: Second ODI (Adelaide). ,Jan 18: Third ODI (Melbourne). ,Sri Lanka: ,Jan 24-28: First Test (Brisbane, D/N). ,Feb 1-5: Second Test (Canberra).",2018-05-01,https://www.dawn.com/news/1404950/bcci-resists-cas-overtures-for-adelaide-day-night-test,"BCCI resists CA’s overtures for Adelaide day-night Test

Khowaja has expressed these apprehensions in a letter he recently wrote to the Sindh government, according to senior police officers.,The SHC in its judgement on petitions of civil society organisations had called for ensuring “autonomy of command and operational independence of police”.,The SHC had also directed the Sindh cabinet to promulgate a new Police Act in line with its judgement, which was also upheld by the Supreme Court on March 22, 2018. However, the detailed judgement of the SC is still awaited.,A.D. Khowaja expresses apprehensions in letter to Sindh govt,The IGP in his letter also advised the provincial government to delay the proposed legislation to “benefit from the jurisprudential wisdom and practical guidance” of the apex court in matters related to the reinforcement of the police as an institution and protection of citizens’ fundamental rights.,According to the IGP’s letter, the SHC had also directed the government to notify rules to be proposed by the IGP in the light of the said judgement. However, instead of notifying the rules, the Sindh government has introduced a “new police act”.,The proposed police act “obviously negates the spirit and clear directions of the SHC and SC judgements,” said Mr Khowaja in his letter.,He warned the government that any attempt to violate the principles laid down by the superior courts would prompt further litigation.,Therefore, Mr Khowaja advised the government to “reconsider” the proposed police act and the new law should “reinforce the institutional, legal, structural and administrative foundations of police force”., ,Informed sources told Dawn that recently a meeting was held, which was attended by IGP, all AIGs and DIGs of Sindh, the home and law ministers, in which the police made their recommendations about the proposed police act.,It was pointed out in the police briefing that the proposed police act appeared to be an “attempt to strengthen the political and bureaucratic control over police”.,Besides, the draft act also lacked external democratic and public oversight and community participation in police affairs.,Furthermore, it was stated that the provincial government had prepared the new police act without a “consultation process”.,As per the presentation, insertion of Section 12 in the new police act takes away the administrative authority and operational independence of the office of the IGP.,Moreover, the proposed procedure of posting of IGP was in “violation of the agreement between federal and provincial governments (1993 agreement) as enunciated in the SHC judgment.”,According to the police presentation, the spirit of the SHC judgement regarding the tenure of IGP and other senior police officers has been violated without giving due process through compelling reasons as set in the famous Anita Turab case.,The police leadership in the meeting proposed that instead of adopting the old model of bureaucratic control, the new police act must be based on modern and democratic policing principles, and the spirit of the apex courts’ judgement must be incorporated.",2018-05-01,https://www.dawn.com/news/1404975/igp-fears-draft-police-act-may-undermine-spirit-of-shc-sc-judgements,"IGP fears draft police act may undermine spirit of SHC, SC judgements

At the outset, the bench became irked when a deputy attorney general sought more time to file the report. ,Justice Ahmed said that apparently the authorities concerned were taking the court orders lightly and warned that the establishment division secretary would be held accountable if the order was not complied with within two weeks.,The provincial authorities and an apex court-appointed inquiry committee’s head through the reports informed the apex court in December that 12,000 police officials were found involved in misuse of powers and had patchy backgrounds and about the action taken against them.,According to the reports, former provincial police officer of Sindh Ghulam Haider Jamali, former DIG for training Shahab Mazhar Bhalli, former AIG for finance Fida Hussain, SSP Ghulam Azfar Mahesar, Matiari district SP Amjad Ahmed Shaikh and other top-rank officials’ conduct was found illegal.,However, the provincial authorities said that since they could not take action against the police officers above grade 17, their cases were sent to the establishment division for disciplinary proceedings in accordance with the law and service rules., ,Meanwhile, the same bench on Monday dismissed the appeals of around a dozen primary schoolteachers appointed on contract basis.,The appellants, Sadiq Ali and other teachers, moved the apex court against a judgement of the Sindh High Court which declared their appointment illegal.,The counsel for the appellants contended that the teachers were appointed on a contract basis and later they were sacked, adding that there were over 16,000 teachers, appointed on contract basis, but the appellants were singled out and removed from service.

The bill aimed at amending the Karachi Development Authority Order, 1975.,It sparked a debate when the opposition benches said converting amenity plots through a generic legislation could open floodgates of conversion of amenity plots in the city, many of which had already been illegally converted for residential and commercial purposes in the past and the matter attracted the Sindh High Court to take cognizance of it.,Muttahida Qaumi Movement’s parliamentary party leader Syed Sardar Ahmed said that the amendment was gravely generic, which could expose all the amenity plots to the whims of the government of the day.,Some MPAs say they are receiving death threats from banned outfits,“Take this issue seriously,” said Mr Ahmed. “Or, we’ll see every amenity plot in Karachi housing commercial structures.”,Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s Samar Ali Khan also said the bill was too generic.,Originally, a clause in the bill says: “[The] government may, if it considers that the conversion or utilisation of amenity plot is of public importance and recording the reasons thereof in writing, allow the conversion or utilisation of such amenity plot.”,Another clause reads: “The amenity plots can be converted to other public purposes only for [the] government-sponsored Mass Transit Projects subject to the approval of the government [cabinet].”,Minister Lanjar insisted that the bill had carried no hidden agenda and would not benefit individuals or groups. ,MQM’s Faisal Subzwari said the government should declare which plots it actually wanted to convert for the mass transit project.,Transport Minister Nasir Shah said an elaborate mass transit system was around the corner and there were certain areas where the government had no space available for the projects. He said the bill related to government-funded transport only involving no commercial activity whatsoever.,Opposition Leader Khwaja Izharul Hasan said that the issue was certainly specific and the house should be told about it.,As Mr Lanjar failed to convince the opposition, Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah rose and said that the house had no further time because of the coming budget session. The bill was of huge importance with no mala fide content and merited being passed immediately, he added.,Mr Shah offered the house to suggest and include certain amendments.,Later, Samar Ali Khan and Mohammad Hussain of the joint opposition held talks with Minister Lanjar and after a consensus the bill was amended by keeping conversion of specific plots for the mass transit purpose. ,In the amended bill, the government was allowed to convert two amenity plots — ST Plot-1 in Sector 4, Surjani and KDA Ground, Numaish, for the project., ,In supplementary agenda, Mr Lanjar presented the Sindh Land Tax and Agricultural Income Tax Ordinance, 2000 (Amendment) Bill, 2018.,It omitted the land tax entirely or substituted it with advance agricultural tax in various clauses and sub-clauses.,It changed the rates of tax on total agricultural income by imposing no agricultural tax where the total income does not exceed Rs1.2 million. Earlier, the least tax was five per cent of the income where the total income does not exceed Rs1m.,CM Shah said his government would also amend the rules to ensure that owners having certain acreage should file tax returns.,PTI’s Samar Khan said collection of taxes had been the major issue.

However, there has not been a single word from the quarters concerned on how to polish or honour talented athletes.,Currently in Pakistan, players of almost all sports — barring cricket — are facing an uncertain future due to sheer government apathy towards facilitating promising athletes several of whom, past and present, have recorded impressive achievements in their respective discipline at international level. ,Needless to say, there is an acute need for the government to come out with a comprehensive and long-term national sports policy aimed at not only providing best coaching and equipment to the players, but also at protecting their future after retirement.,The main hurdle in the way of sports development in Pakistan is that there is no specific policy on grooming talented athletes and honouring them for their achievements in cut-throat international competitions. ,Numerous such examples have surfaced recently where former sportspersons — some of them renowned for their magnificent achievements during their playing days — are leading life riddled with suffering.,The case of Olympian Mansoor Ahmed, Pakistan’s hockey World Cup-winning goalkeeper, perhaps tops the present list of sportspersons who have been practically abandoned by the authorities concerned. ,Mansoor, whose memorable save in the shootout against the Netherlands helped Pakistan clinch the 1994 World Cup final in Sydney, has been fighting for life due to a heart disease. Presently, he is admitted to a hospital in Karachi.,While the goalkeeper, who remains in critical condition, recently has sought help from the Indian government to arrange his treatment in India, it is time for Pakistan’s authorities concerned to think about the level of indifference they have reached regarding national heroes, particularly after their retirement. Moreover, the goalkeeper, according to a latest media report, has refused an offer made by an institution in the country to treat him citing “Pakistan does not have enough facilities” signifies there is a lot requiring change in our social sector.,Wrestler Inam Butt and weightlifter Nooh Dastgir Butt, who clinched a gold and a bronze medal, respectively at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games held last month have also mentioned the lack of facilities provided to them by the government in the lead-up to the Games. Only personal hard work and self-financing enabled them to earn the medals.,Another such case is of karateka Saadi Abbas who has also made Pakistan proud recently by becoming the first South Asian player to who attain the 10th ranking in the Karate-1 Premier League.,However, to maintain this position or to move further ahead, Saadi needs sponsors. Unfortunately, he missed out on a league in Morocco, mainly because he had no sponsor, which will no doubt affect his 10th ranking in the future. Despite his appeal, the government has not yet given any concrete response to Saadi in this regard.,During the last several years the Punjab government time and again has also been claiming of building hundreds of stadiums and sports complexes. However, hardly it could offer any specific policy for the promotion and development of athletes.,The system of maintaining old and outdated sports infrastructure has also damaged sports in Pakistan. If the scenario remains the same development in the country’s sports in all probability will remain a daydream.,If anyone reads the constitution of the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB), he will find that it is responsible to provide coaches, trainers, infrastructure and other facilities to athletes. However, the annual PSB budget is less than Rs1 billion and a major chunk of even this amount is consumed on meeting administration’s expenses.,Unless athletes are provided with best training, coaching, gear and diet, better-equipped sports infrastructure alone cannot make its contribution for the betterment of sports.,There are media reports that Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi is going to hold a meeting with sports stakeholders in Islamabad during the first week of May. Hopefully, along with other related issues genuine problems faced by the country’s athletes of all disciplines also come under discussion at this meeting.,India, Pakistan’s arch-rival, has made significant progress in sports development during recent years. They have done it by heavily investing on infrastructure as well as facilitating their athletes. No wonder India remained third on the final medals table at the Gold Coast Games. This is a sign that India will emerge as a major force in this year’s Asian Games.,Meanwhile, when contacted for his word on the recent government announcement of building of 100 stadiums, POA president retired Lt Gen Arif Hasan said, “Building stadiums without a coherent infrastructure development plan and policy would be a waste of money and resources. ,“Will they be multi-purpose or single purpose? Have we carried out a census on how many stadiums have been built unto now and what state are they in now? If at all stadiums are built they should, for the time being, built in major cities/provincial capitals only and should be of international standard,” Arif added.,“Instead of stadiums, a greater number of playing grounds should be made available in each ward/union/tehsil/district. These should be close to the schools/colleges etc and those should have grass, watering system and a few men to maintain it. Should have lights so that the facility could be used during hot weather.,“Modern equipment is required to train on. Our weightlifters could have performed even better [on Gold coast] had they been trained on latest equipment, and nutrition is also a key aspect,” the POA chief added.",2018-05-01,https://www.dawn.com/news/1404976/comment-infrastructure-without-facilitating-athletes-not-to-produce-desired-results,"Comment: Infrastructure without facilitating athletes not to produce desired results

"May 01, 2018","The , was inaugurated by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi — after going through its share of hiccups — on Tuesday.,The plan to construct a new airport in Islamabad had been conceived just under forty years ago in 1980 but work on the international-standard greenfield airport hit a number of snags and delays over the years. ,			,The Y-shaped airport is located 20 kilometres from Zero Point Islamabad and over 25km from Saddar, Rawalpindi, and is set to be the largest airport in the country, designed to facilitate 15 million passengers annually in the first phase, which will increase to 25m after its expansion.,IIA today saw its first commercial touchdown with Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight PK-300 landing at the new airport at 11:15am. ,			,According to PIA Spokesman Mashood Tajwar, the national flag carrier's second commercial flight PK-301 will take off for Karachi at around 12:30pm.,Strict security measures were in place as PM Abbasi arrived at the airport along with other officials for the ceremony. The inauguration was initially supposed to take place on April 20 but it was delayed until May 3 due to certain technical problems and security issues.,Speaking at the inauguration ceremony, Abbasi lauded the efforts of Sardar Mehtab, Irfan Illahi and Air Marshal Salam and other officials for their efforts to complete the airport project.,			,""Nothing is impossible, but this [constructing this airport] seemed like it was,"" the prime minister said. ""But we have managed to complete this project as well."",He further said that although Pakistan's ""liberal, open sky scheme"" has been criticised, the policy has been kept in place because the government believes that the ""passengers should have choices"".,""Aviation is a challenging, dynamic field. It keeps changing rapidly and if we don't change ourselves we will be left behind,"" he stressed.,""It is very easy to criticise and hurl accusations,"" he said, adding that those in government have to deal with challenges unknown to critics.,			,Full flight operations will be shifted to the new airport on May 3. All commercial and VIP flights from Benazir Bhutto International Airport (BBIA) will be moved to the new airport.,International carriers, including Emirates Airlines, Qatar Airways, Thai Airways, China Airlines, Oman Air, Etihad Airways, Saudi Airways, Gulf Air, Kuwait Airways and Turkish Airlines, operate flights to and from Islamabad along with PIA, Shaheen Air and Air Blue.,Prior to the inauguration, the Pakistan Air Force had lent a hand to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for smooth and safe conduct of operations at the new airport.,A C-130 flight with passengers and luggage on board had landed at the newly constructed runway on Friday to assess its instrument landing pattern and the quality of the landing strip.,			,Earlier, PAF aircraft, including the lightweight super Mushshak trainer and Hercules transport aircraft, had also landed at the runway.,For air traffic deconfliction, PAF in consultation with the CAA air traffic controllers has readjusted its flying training areas and routes for smooth approach paths of the new airport.,Moreover, PAF has also established an air traffic control squadron manned by qualified controllers to ensure the smooth air traffic flow at the airport.,			,Reaching a decision over a final name of the airport proved to be a major challenge for the authorities. ,On April 20, former Senate chairman Raza Rabbani, after hearing that that an adviser to the prime minister has announced that Benazir Bhutto International Airport would be named Islamabad International Airport, in a letter , and ""withdraw this uncalled for and inappropriate decision"".,However, the official name of the airport had not been decided until last week after the , that had been proposed by Nawaz Sharif-constituted ministerial committee for Islamabad’s new airport.,Besides a four-level terminal building, two runways, taxiways, apron and two parking bays for wide-body aircraft A-380 have been built. There will also be a cargo terminal, fuel farm, air traffic control complex as well as a fully-functional state-of-the-art firefighting station and modern rescue facilities.,The new airport will have 15 air-conditioned jetways or passenger boarding bridges, 13 remote bays for larger aircraft and 7 remote bays for ATR and other smaller planes, in addition to four cargo bays. ,Of the 15 jetways – two have been specified for the wide-body aircraft A380. The Benazir Bhutto International Airport had no boarding bridges and suffered from a chronically inadequate immigration desk. The small number of immigration officers could not handle the influx of thousands of passengers flying in every day.,The new airport will have five conveyer belts to assist passengers in claiming their luggage and personal belongings after they exit their planes. All 15 bays will have separate lounges to make it easier for travellers to navigate to the correct waiting areas.,At level 1 – there are the international and domestic passengers’ arrival area and collection bays for baggage. Airline offices and the engineering department will also be housed on the first level.,At level II – there are the domestic arrivals and departure lounges, boarding bridges, visitors’ gallery, car parking, and Immigration counters for international passengers.,At level III – there are international and domestic check-ins – baggage drop after check-in security scanning, international immigration departure and other airlines offices.,At level IV – there are state lounges and commercially important persons (CIP) lounges, in addition, a crew briefing hall.,There will be as many as 28 escalators, six service lifts. 24 elevators for passengers have been installed in the terminal building in addition to 4 inclined travellators (moving walkways) and 10 horizontal. ,25 restrooms for passengers have been built in the terminal building, however, there is no facility for transit passengers to deposit their luggage. ,Instead, transit passengers will have to carry their luggage with them while waiting for their connecting flights. The Benazir Bhutto Airport did not have this facility either.,A huge parking area for 2200 to 2500 vehicles has been constructed, in addition to a 175-staff car parking bay. And two parking areas have been allocated for state lounge guests. There are nine exit and entry gates to the airport.,Other amenities include dedicated charging stations for passengers to fuel up their electronic devices. In addition, there are charging boxes for cell-phones that will be operated by high-tech fingerprint recognition systems for keeping the phones safe while they are being charged.,There will also be a mini-cinema for travellers to relax and watch a movie before embarking on their connecting flights, as well as a food court with a children’s play area.,From Islamabad, the airport is connected to the Kashmir Highway, while people in Rawalpindi will be able to access it via the Grand Trunk Road. There is no dedicated public transport available to the airport; however, government authorities have plans to inaugurate a metro-bus service for passengers soon.,Besides all other facilities, 18 water tube-wells and three water dams have been built for the new airport. However, arrangements for the availability of clean drinking water have yet to be finalised.,More than 500 Airport Security Force personnel will be required to be deployed at the new IIA to ensure safety for all passengers.,Security officials, however, have already expressed concern over the existing situation of funnel areas of the new airport which are close to the Motorway where lights could be a security hazard.,Though more than 85 security towers have been built around the airport to ensure that nobody from outside can enter the area, several of the towers lack basic facilities like toilets/washroom, lighting and restrooms.,“No clean water is available to drink at the security towers, and it’s difficult to keep visual contact from the towers to the airport,” a security official – requesting to remain unnamed — lamented speaking of the lapses in security management.,The security staff camp is located 12 kilometres away from the airport which security officials consider a cause for concern. The airport itself lacks proper rescue and evacuation mechanisms.,There are also no alternate routes for VIPs, which according to security officials would have the potential to create traffic bottlenecks as well as security hazards.,“The Benazir Bhutto International Airport was a smaller airport, which meant that security management was not so complicated. Considering the new airport is significantly larger, the security detail needs to be much more comprehensive. Given the fact that the location of the airport is also in an area where there have been reports of miscreant activities, security arrangements are not water-tight” a security official said.,He said at the new airport, security management systems, CCTV, and public address systems have been installed complimented with all-night patrolling. There are two bomb pit facilities each on the departure and international sections of the airport.,Besides the on-site hotel, a flight kitchen, post office facilities and ATMs have yet to be provided to passengers using the new airport. However, the PIA spokesman said that the flight kitchen located at the old Benazir Bhutto International airport, which is more than 30 kilometres away from the new airport will be used for cooking meals, which will be transported in trucks to the new airport.",2018-05-01,https://www.dawn.com/news/1404991/nothing-is-impossible-pm-abbasi-inaugurates-islamabad-international-airport,"'Nothing is impossible': PM Abbasi inaugurates Islamabad International Airport

The people recognise you very well."",""You held a rally in Liaquatabad, which is our [MQM's] centre, knowing that you will not be harmed. Why don't you hold such a rally in Lyari?"" Siddiqui challenged the PPP, asking if Bilawal had anything to say about the notorious Lyari gang wars, which he alleged were engineered by the PPP's ""militant wings"". ,Militancy in Karachi has diminished in the years following the launch of a Rangers operation in 2013. During the operation, the MQM's Nine-Zero headquarters were shut down and the party's alleged militant wing was dismantled.,Lyari gang war leaders have also been rounded up, with the infamous , in the area in 2017, and another leader, ,.,Siddiqui today announced that the MQM would respond to Bilawal's onslaught at FC's Tanki Ground in Liaquatabad on May 5, the venue where the PPP held its rally over the weekend. ,The MQM-P Bahadurabad leader invited all political parties in Karachi, including the Farooq Sattar-led MQM-P PIB rival faction, to come together at the rally in order to reclaim the city. ,""Karachi only progressed when , ruled the city,"" Siddiqui claimed.,Siddiqui also raised questions over Bilawal's ""legitimacy as PPP's chairman"" by pointing out that the party had a dynastic structure.,Siddiqui also addressed MQM's breakup with the party's founder, saying that his party members had ""stood by their leader through thick and thin"" but abandoned him in the national interest. ,The party split after founder Altaf Hussain made anti-Pakistan remarks in August 2016, leading to an attack on the offices of a local media group. The Rangers took MQM leaders into custody overnight, following which Farooq Sattar announced the next day that the party was sidelining Hussain, thus leading to the formation of the MQM-P. ,The MQM-P has since then fallen to infighting which became most apparent during the Senate elections this year, causing the Pakistan wing of the party to be split further into two groups, the Bahadurabad faction and the PIB Colony faction. ,In April, Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif ─ , ─ met Siddiqui and other party members at the Bahadurabad group's office, after which both leaders held a joint press conference. The PML-N president called for all parties to work together for the betterment of Karachi, vowing to turn into ""the New York of South Asia"" if his party was elected to power in the upcoming election.

"May 01, 2018","From where I sit in my wheelchair, the world seems a pretty insensitive place to a differently-abled person’s plight.,I became paralysed from the neck down following a car accident in 2002 on the Lahore-Islamabad motorway. My sister, who was in the car with me, lost her life on that fateful day.,The subsequent professional nursing care that I received  was severely inadequate. Sandbags and neck collars to stabilise the neck were unavailable at hospitals.,Unable to talk after a badly done operation, my main way of communication was by blinking. To get the attention of sleeping nurses, I would often bite on my ventilator tube to stop the oxygen supply and set off the alarm.,Lack of proper paramedic care left me with little chance of any substantial recovery. But subsequent rehab treatment in Aylesbury, England provided me with a ray of hope, with excellent nursing care and accessibility of wheelchair users to all socioeconomic backgrounds helping in my rehabilitation.,I came back to Pakistan with a renewed sense of hope and determination, and tried to not let circumstances dictate my life.,However, it soon became apparent that I would not be able to enjoy the basic comforts of life due to lack of access to buildings for wheelchair users. ,I was routinely inconvenienced in going to school, clinics, weddings, movies, restaurants, stores, banks etc. due to the lack of ramps and lifts for those in a wheelchair.,Far too often, my access was dependent on whether good Samaritans
  and/or staff would help carry me up the steps.,Never mind the fact that being physically lifted each time created a health hazard for me, as I was exposed to further injuries and paralysis.,I spoke out on , and , media about my story, and the importance of making sure access for the differently-abled was included in building plans.,However, without tangible ways to effectuate my goals, the media and the public’s initial enthusiasm naturally waned with time. ,My impatience grew, and recently, I engaged with a civil advocacy law firm to explore this subject.,Much to my surprise, I discovered that the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) had mandatory tailor-made provisions for differently-abled persons in public buildings.,Regulation 6.2.3 of the LDA Building and Zoning Regulations 2007 , that:,Needless to say, this provision has not been implemented by the LDA, nor has it been adopted by commercial/public buildings and apartments.,Most places do not have ramps for wheelchair users. The seldom presence of wheelchair ramps is often an afterthought and, as a result, poorly designed and promoted.  ,I have yet to see a single toilet within the LDA’s jurisdiction (or otherwise) that accommodates “disabled” persons.,A few restaurants in recent times have been generous to build ramps (or have portable ramps) after I highlighted the issue to them.   ,I authored letters to the LDA on behalf of the marginalised wheelchair community, imploring them to implement their own regulations.,After the initial forwarding of my letter to the concerned department for action, there was the predictable lack of correspondence afterwards.,My impatience reached fever pitch, and I was constrained to personally visit the LDA head office in Johar Town, Lahore. ,Upstairs, my colleagues had to speak on my behalf to the officials, and I was left out of meaningful discourse (barring one official coming down to see me later).,While the officials acknowledged the legitimate grievances to my colleagues, they used insubstantial reasons to justify the lack of past and current enforcement.,This included stating that the regulations did not apply to buildings that were made before 2008 (notwithstanding the fact that the regulations were written as applicable to all buildings irrespective of construction date) and that the enforcement required a lot of surveying man-power, which required extensive preparation and time (notwithstanding the fact that the regulations have existed for 10 years).,We exited the building with a semblance of hope and expectation. However, recent communications with the LDA have been met with muffled concern, as they have showcased lack of urgency on their part.,Apart from sending notices to the buildings identified by us, no documentary evidence has been shared to demonstrate substantial overhaul.,This is notwithstanding the fact that it is an open secret that LDA regulations have been violated for the past decade with impunity, with little to no action taken.,I am cautiously optimistic that the LDA will take concrete action in the near future on my rather simple demands.,Access to buildings in a safe and secure manner is a gateway for wheelchair users in their pursuit of life, liberty and happiness.,This does not just impact quadriplegic wheelchair users such as myself, but also other people having to use wheelchairs, such as persons suffering from amputation, arthritis, cerebral palsy, multiple-sclerosis, post-polio syndrome, back disorders and old-age weaknesses.,The state has systematically made wheelchair users feel invisible,
  unwanted and unwelcome as a part of its fabric.,With the continual lack of facilities for wheelchair users to access buildings, we as a marginalised community have been systematically deprived of meaningful access to basic healthcare, education, employment and enjoyment of life.,With lack of enforcement by bodies regulating buildings over the past decade, one would think that the courts of law would be a decent avenue for enforcement of rights.,However, far too often, public interest petitions seeking for enforcement of differently-abled persons’ rights become muddled with various state entities seeking time to respond. ,This ultimately leads to a slow decay of interest in such cases, with little to no progress.,The last ray of hope, for better or worse, is the LDA developing a conscience and acting on its own volition. We, the wheelchair users, are at the LDA’s mercy.,Access for us is not just about putting in ramps, but without ramps, we have no gateway to a meaningful life.",2018-05-01,https://www.dawn.com/news/1405003/my-long-quest-for-wheelchair-accessible-buildings-in-lahore,"My long quest for wheelchair accessible buildings in Lahore

"May 01, 2018","			,I WAS introduced to the concept of dissent in the 1980s when I overheard a conversation among my father’s friends. They said a group of women had scared Gen Ziaul Haq so much that in a televised address he warned the people not to be misled by these few 200 bourgeois westernised women who were opposing his Islamisation regime. Their half-admiration, and half-amusement at Zia’s fear of women, may well have underestimated the Women’s Action Forum, but the shrewd general and conservatives were right to fear any dissent, however fledgling.,WAF, of which I am a member, went on to spearhead the main opposition to Ziaul Haq’s regime and its discriminatory laws and subsequent military adventures. The point is that dissent is never innocuous, and it should worry the self-serving guardians of the status quo but not those who stand for progress and justice.,Postcolonial scholars and right-wing conservatives oppose enlightenment rights, human rights laws, or modernity for Pakistan and offer religious laws and culture as substitutes. The liberals too, cling on desperately to the compromised heirs of the opportunistic PPP. The defeatist argument is that dissent to achieve equality is too utopian, parochial and ineffective against the powerful establishment, and so, we should just work realistically within the system.,Dissent is the highest form of patriotism.,All three groups miss the point of a new wave of dissent and, therefore, the associated opportunities. Current uprisings in Pakistan confirm that it is not the source, scale or span of dissent that matters but its potential to capture the imagination. It is the depth of subversive promise that makes an idea threatening. It is the unpredictability of causes and the unlikelihood of new subversive actors that creates anxiety and throws the balance of powers off the scale. Usually, these ideas have to do with politics, sex, nation and religion. When dissent speaks in a female voice or with an ethnic minority accent, the anxiety is doubled.,Elected governments are completing their terms. Pulling out the corruption card against them may curb the confidence of the parties but they are resisting and fighting back. This spirit for political autonomy is new and scary, and can no longer be subtle. ,Liberals and conservatives are more agreeable on this electoral independence business. Journalists are risking their lives and careers — not to cover ethnic battlefields but to question civil-military relations.,Judicial activism is likely to be a limited form of heroism. It is not in the Federal Shariat Court but the ordinary courts where judges are weeping over a random post perceived as blasphemous or are offended by the appearance of a heart-shaped Valentine’s Day balloon. Will we even need an FSC if the ordinary courts compete to protect us from moral and political corruption and save Islam? The tension between constitutional rights/freedoms and moral abstractions are untenable and increasing dissent is challenging such contradictions. ,A handful of dissenting bloggers — on the issue of nationalism or religion — trigger anxiety of such overwhelming proportions that one would think they had made constitutional amendments. On the other hand, a law department makes an administrative lapse that would only have meant missing one of the many opportunities to repeat our determined belief in declaring Ahmedis non-Muslims once in five years. Yet, this results in sleepless nights, blood lust, blocked highways and a prescribed witch-hunt.,It was not a glossy Oscar-winning documentary but the defiant Qandeel Baloch who exposed the sham of male honour. She subverted the notion that all victims deserve sympathy because they are always innocent. Instead, Qandeel flaunted her sexual autonomy and represented a post-Zina law moment. Sex is part of national conversations, and sexual harassment is being subverted — from being used as a tool to shame the victim into one that can hold the perpetrator to account. ,Dissent is not betrayal — it is the highest form of patriotism because it wants change within. Dissent is an opportunity for an inclusive conversation rather than fearful rejection. ,Teaching facts rather than fiction about Pakistan’s history, revisiting the ‘war on terror’ agreement and CPEC’s terms and conditions, respecting sexual equality, criticising national leaders, exposing false heroes and seedy celebrities, calling out failed policies … these are all potentially subversive actions. But suppressing information, silencing inquiry and disappearing political activists will only leave wounds untreated. ,Dissent should be considered a form of catharsis towards a more harmonious, consensual future. This can’t be achieved by embracing appeasement or scoring points via blame and slogans. There’s a bitter sweetness in dissent because it’s a painful but peaceful cry of dissatisfaction and demand for change. The sound of dissent is perhaps what was meant in the lyrics of the song by Prince, ‘This is what it sounds like when doves cry’.

While unions are hardly as powerful as they once were, it is also true that the state has ignored workplace safety regulations, with the result that many working men and women have lost their lives in horrific industrial accidents that could have been avoided had safety measures been in place. ,The , (in which it is suspected criminal elements were involved in deliberate arson) and the fire at the Gadani ship-breaking yard in 2016 instantly come to mind. ,These are just some of the major examples; workers across this land have to operate in hazardous workspaces on a daily basis. ,The fact is that people are desperate for work and unscrupulous employers exploit this need by making labourers work in unsafe conditions.,As activists have pointed out, governments — federal and provincial — must make occupational safety and health a priority and ensure that working conditions within their jurisdictions are safe. ,This means, of course, ratifying the requisite ILO conventions and legislating where necessary. But beyond the paperwork, enforcement is needed to ensure that workers are operating in spaces that meet legal health and safety standards. ,What is more, labour courts need to be made more active so that they can adjudicate on cases speedily. ,While the system indeed favours big business and only pays lip service to the working classes, it is time those political parties that swear by progressive and egalitarian ideals put their money where their mouth is: it is election year and parties in their manifestos must clearly enunciate what they intend to do to improve the lot of workers. ,Working people are not asking for much; all they want is dignity and respect, safe workplaces and a better future for their children.

Let the opponents go on with their hundred emotional somersaults. The important thing is to remain sensible, preferably with a smile, while doing your own pirouette, if for no other reason than to keep the rival guessing. ,That’s what Kim Jong-un just did with Donald Trump. The North Korean leader Trump reviled as a nuclear-trigger happy buffoon is being lauded as a potential harbinger of peace in a fraught region of the world. Trump who believes he can discipline anyone with his forbidding military arsenal looks set to lose the mid-term polls for his party. ,Both sides of the Korean Peninsula have heaved a big sigh of relief as has the neighbourhood and beyond. All it took was for the young North Korean leader to ,. The line he crossed is a Cold War relic that has lingered on like the grin of the Cheshire cat, which was the last to vanish. ,The most photographed embrace between the estranged Korean leaders, their globally watched stroll, the watering of a shared tree of blessing and the spontaneous banter, the promise to end nuclear brinkmanship, the resolve to go to the Olympics as a joint team are all stories that have been dreamt and even pondered in South Asia by people in India and Pakistan, together and separately.,There are some obvious similarities and there are very crucial differences between the Korean Peninsula and South Asia. One was divided by the Cold War, the other created by colonialism. A cursory glance at the map would reveal a curious feature. Most countries divided by the Cold War have been reunited. Germany, Vietnam, Yemen come to mind. The Koreas look primed as the next. The fact remains that those divided by colonialism remain estranged, in Africa most notably. Palestine and Ireland are prime examples. ,There are some obvious similarities and some very crucial differences between the Korean Peninsula and South Asia.,One doesn’t have to look too hard to see the obvious similarities and how the Korean situation replicates itself in broad contours in South Asia. For that we need to ignore the historical detail. ,Consider the main similarities that really matter today. Pakistan’s worldview is aligned with China as is North Korea’s, while India looks betrothed to the US-led West not unlike South Korea. The Cold War equation was drastically different in South Asia, when the proverbial boot was on the other foot, when the American and British embassies in Delhi lionised Kashmiri resistance. Today, the main global anchors in South Asia and the Korean Peninsula are almost identical.,We don’t know the essential details of the meeting that took place last week ,. The public face offered a reminder of the 1993 event in Beijing when Narasimha Rao and Li Peng signed the landmark agreement on peace and tranquillity on their borders. Reference to that agreement, handiwork of a typically Chinese draftsmanship, was heard again at the Xi-Modi summit. There was also mention of some kind of cooperation in Afghanistan. ,There is an important event ahead when the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meets in China in June. Indian and Pakistani leaders would be there. But already a far-reaching agreement seems to be in place whereby Indian and Pakistani troops would be for the first time involved in a joint multinational military exercise in Russia to combat terrorism.,The agreement announced by the Indian defence minister masks a philosophy deeper than the fact of sending their troops to a multinational exercise under the aegis of SCO. It is an inescapable fact that both sides would be ,. In other words, they have to first accept that they have a common target, a shared understanding of the foe. That is a formula that seems to go back to the Manmohan Singh and Pervez Musharraf agreement when they decided that their talks would not be derailed by acts of terrorism. Ironies! ,On a larger canvas, the ascendant rulers in Pakistan and India are precisely those that did not want a partition in the first place. But they were vehemently opposed to it not because they believed in inclusive secularism or democracy but because they wanted the entire landmass of India to themselves, one eyeing it as a Muslim empire the other drooling at the prospects of a Hindu hegemony. The RSS and the Jamaat were both opposed to a divided Indian subcontinent and they are both controlling if not directly wielding power in their respective domains today. This is different from the Koreas where both sides that met for a handshake and a landmark photo-op represent the ideas that divided them. To work around those differences is civilised. That is what democracies were meant to do. ,Where there is hope from the Korean Peninsula, there’s not much positive energy trickling through for a South Asian encore. That, however, doesn’t mean there is no need to work for a rapprochement nor that it isn’t doable. Today, Jinnah would be scratching his head with disbelief at the narrow ideas they have imposed on his country to stifle women and random communities. ,Nehru and Gandhi are openly accused of betrayal. It would be news if they weren’t. A few months before his death in 1964, Nehru had said that India wanted a confederation with Pakistan. “But every time we mention it, they get frightened.” ,Consider this: what was so frightening about crossing a demarcation line that nobody on the peninsula saw as terribly helpful? Jinnah saw the need for Pakistan as a last resort. Gandhi accepted it grudgingly. And their admirers don’t see the point even when their dreams are exploding.

Life at the time was hard, people were without work, prices were going through the roof. Some Taliban approached me.,“What are you doing?” they demanded.,“Nothing,” I answered. “I’m taking pictures of the bread!” Luckily this was in the age before digital cameras, so they couldn’t check to make sure I was telling the truth.,I rarely put my name on my photos at the time, I just signed them “stringer”, so as not to draw unwanted attention to myself., didn’t really have a bureau here back then, we had a house in the same neighbourhood, Wazir Akbar Khan, that we do today. Special envoys would take turns coming here, and we would regularly go to the frontline on the Shomali Plain, where the Northern Alliance was holding out against the Taliban.,Aside from the BBC, only the three agencies, — ,, , and , — remained in the city. Then in 2000 all of the foreigners were finally chased out and I was left alone to hold down the fort at ,’s bureau. I would phone in information to the Islamabad bureau with a satellite phone.,I watched the September 11 attacks on the BBC, not thinking for a second that there would be possible repercussions for Afghanistan. It was the Islamabad bureau that warned me some days later: “Rumours are that the Americans are going to attack.” ,The bombings began less than a month later, on October 7, targeting the city of Kandahar near the Pakistani border, that the Taliban had made as their capital.,I was in the middle of phoning in the information to Islamabad when I heard the planes over Kabul. The first bombs were dropped near the airport. I didn’t sleep that night, but I couldn’t go outside.,The following morning I headed to the airport in my car. Not far from it, I came across a group of several dozen Taliban fighters, dressed in black.,One of them approached me. “Listen, I’m nice today so I’m not going to kill you, but get out of here right away.” I turned around, drove back and left my car at the office. The city was deserted. I came back with my bike, like an ordinary guy, a scarf wrapped around my hand to hide my camera. I took six photos that day, just six. I ended up sending two of them.,Then one morning, the Taliban were gone, vanishing into thin air. You should have seen it. The streets were filled with people.

Everywhere was safe.,And then in 2004, the Taliban came back. First in the Ghazni province in the southeast.
