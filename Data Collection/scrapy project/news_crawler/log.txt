{'date': u' March 01, 2018', 'text': [u"Putting fellow Republicans in the hot seat, President Donald Trump called for speedy and substantial changes to the nation's gun laws, then criticised lawmakers in a White House meeting for being too fearful of the National Rifle Association (NRA) to take action. ", u"In a freewheeling, televised session that stretched for an hour on Wednesday, Trump rejected both his party's incremental approach and its legislative strategy that has stalled action in Congress. ", u'Giving hope to Democrats, he said he favoured a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d approach to addressing violence like the shooting at a Florida high school earlier this month, although he offered no specific details. ', u'Instead, Trump again voiced his support for expanded background checks. He endorsed increased school security and mental health resources, and he reaffirmed his support for raising the age to 21 for purchasing some firearms. ', u'Trump also mentioned arming teachers, and said his administration, not Congress, would ban bump-stock devices that enable guns to fire like automatic weapons with an executive order.', u"\u201cWe can't wait and play games and nothing gets done,\u201d Trump said as he opened the session with 17 House and Senate lawmakers. \u201cWe want to stop the problems.\u201d ", u"Trump also raised eyebrows by suggesting that law enforcement officials should be able to confiscate people's firearms without a court order to prevent potential tragedies.", u'\u201cTake the guns first, go through due process second,\u201d he suggested. ', u'The president has previously backed ideas popular with Democrats, only to back away when faced with opposition from his conservative base and his GOP allies in Congress. It was not clear whether he would continue to push for swift and significant changes to gun laws when confronted with the inevitable resistance from his party. ', u'Still, the televised discussion allowed Trump to play the role of potential dealmaker, a favourite for the president. Democratic lawmakers made a point of appealing to the president to use his political power to persuade his party to take action. ', u'\u201cIt is going to have to be you,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Trump. ', u"Trump's call for stronger background checks, which are popular among Americans, has been resisted by Republicans in Congress and the NRA. ", u'Republicans have instead been leaning toward modest legislation designed to improve the background system already in place. Trump made clear he was looking for more and accused lawmakers of being \u201cpetrified\u201d of the gun lobby. ', u"\u201cHey, I'm the biggest fan of the Second Amendment,\u201d Trump said, adding that he told NRA officials it's time to act. \u201cWe have to stop this nonsense.\u201d ", u"The White House meeting came amid fresh public debate over gun laws, fuelled by student survivors of the massacre at Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, who have been meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. ", u'Gun legislation has lost momentum in Congress as Republican leaders showed little interest in pursuing stricter gun control laws. ', u"Democrats said they were concerned Trump's interest may fade quickly. After the meeting, Murphy told reporters: \u201cI'm worried that this was the beginning and the end of the president's advocacy on this issue. The White House has to put some meat on the bones. The White House has to send a proposal to Congress.\u201d ", u"The White House is expected to reveal more on the president's plans for school safety later this week. That announcement will likely include goals for background checks and bump stocks, though whether age restrictions will be specifically addressed remains unclear, according to an administration official who sought anonymity to discuss private conversations. ", u'Trump rejected the way Republican leaders in Congress have framed the debate, saying the House-backed bill linking a background check measure with a bill to expand gun rights by allowing gun owners to carry concealed weapons across state lines was not the right approach. ', u"The concealed carry measure is the gun lobby's top legislative priority. But \u201cyou'll never get it passed,\u201d Trump told lawmakers, reminding them that Democratic senators, including some in the room, strongly oppose it. ", u'Instead, he suggested Republicans should focus on the background check bill, then load it up with other gun control and safety measures. ', u'Ever the marketer, Trump suggested that the leading bill adjusting the National Instant Criminal Background Check System now known as \u201cFix NICS\u201d could use a new name. \u201cMaybe you change the title, all right? The U.S. Background Check Bill, or whatever,\u201d Trump said. ', u'The hour-long meeting with lawmakers was reminiscent of one in January on immigration, when he told lawmakers to come up with a good bill and he would take the \u201cheat\u201d from critics. ', u"That effort, however, ended in failure in Congress amid Trump's shifting views and priorities in the debate. ", u'Among those at the White House Wednesday were Sens. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who are pushing their bill it failed twice in the Senate after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting to broaden background checks to include pre-purchase reviews at online and gun show sales. ', u'Trump asked Toomey if his plan to expand background checks included raising the minimum age for young people to buy an assault weapon. Toomey told the president it did not. ', u"\u201cYou know why,\u201d Trump scoffed. \u201cBecause you're afraid of the NRA.\u201d ", u'In fact, Toomey is one of the most high-profile Republicans on gun legislation, and the bill was opposed by the NRA. After earlier votes on the bill, the group downgraded its rating of the senator as he ran for re-election. ', u"The meeting came after one major retailer, Dick's Sporting Goods, announced it was halting sales of assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines at all of its stores and banning the sale of all guns to anyone under 21. ", u"Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, followed late on Wednesday, saying it would no longer sell firearms and ammunition to people younger than 21. ", u'The discussion was billed as a session focused on \u201cschool and community safety,\u201d and two of those attending, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Rep. John Rutherford, R-Fla., have proposed new federal grant funding to stem school violence. ', u'The bill would offer money for law enforcement and school staff training, campus infrastructure upgrades and mental health resources. ', u'With tears, fears and defiance, students also made an emotional return on Wednesday to their Florida high school where a former classmate went on a shooting rampage two weeks ago, killing 17 people. ', u'Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland were greeted by heavy security and scores of well-wishers as they returned to classes. ', u"Dozens of police officers lined the sidewalks saying \u201cGood morning\u201d to each child and retired officers passed out flowers. Former students, neighbours and their children held banners reading \u201cWe Love You,\u201d \u201cYou've Got This\u201d and \u201cWe Are With You.\u201d ", u"\u201cIt's all a little overwhelming,\u201d said one 17-year-old student named William, who shared a classroom with two of the young victims, Nicholas Dworet and Meadow Pollack. ", u'\u201cIt was just sad to go back there and not have my friends who were in the class with me anymore.\u201d ', u'Likewise, for Kimberly Miller, the first day back meant confronting the absence of her geography teacher, 35-year-old Scott Beigel. ', u"Beigel was one of three staff killed, along with 14 teenagers, when former student Nikolas Cruz entered the school on Valentine's Day and opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle. ", u"\u201cIt's pretty upsetting,\u201d said the 14-year-old Miller. \u201cBut it was also refreshing to talk to everyone because people don't really understand how it feels, no matter how much they try to understand.\u201d ", u'While there were few open displays of grief, many students looked sombre, speaking in hushed tones with their eyes downcast. ', u'Jonathan Abramchaev, 15, said it was \u201cvery emotional\u201d to see his school again. ', u'\u201cSeeing all the flowers by the gate, that really hurt me,\u201d he told ', u'. \u201cToday we were just discussing and talking out our feelings.\u201d ', u'Some said they felt reassured \u2014 if a little unsettled \u2014 by the heavy police presence. ', u"\u201cI'm not scared,\u201d said Stoneman Douglas junior Sean Cummings. \u201cI feel like it's more protected than any other school at this point. ", u"\u201cBut it's still weird to see everybody here and all these police officers,\u201d said the 16-year-old. ", u"Others \u2500 like senior Carly Novell \u2500 said they were nervous to return. \u201cI'm really scared to go in,\u201d said Novell, who like many others wore a maroon T-shirt, the school colours. ", u'Broward County school superintendent Robert Runcie said grief counsellors were on hand for the day. ', u"\u201cWe're going to provide as much support as we can,\u201d Runcie told ", u". \u201cStudents are excited. As a family, they're going to pull through it.\u201d ", u'A 15-year-old named Alan said the shooting left him fearful \u2014 even with his school under close watch by police. ', u'\u201cWhat happens when they go? In a couple of days or weeks when it gets back to normal? It may happen again,\u201d he said. ', u'Since the shooting, Stoneman Douglas students have been lobbying politicians for stricter gun controls both in their home state of Florida and in Washington. ', u'Republican lawmakers, with majorities in the US Congress and the Florida state legislature, have been cool on bringing in major reforms on the sales of firearms. ', u'But Trump upped the pressure on lawmakers to get to work, hosting the bipartisan meeting at the White House where he raised eyebrows with his tough stance. ', u'Pressure is also growing on businesses. ', u"On Wednesday, Dick's Sporting Goods, a large chain store, announced it would immediately stop selling assault-style rifles and would not sell guns to anyone under the age of 21. ", u"Dick's CEO Edward Stack said Cruz had purchased a shotgun at one of his stores in November and although it wasn't the gun used in the shooting, the chain would no longer sell semi-automatic weapons. ", u'\u201cOur view was if the kids can be brave enough to organise like this, we can be brave enough to take them out of here,\u201d Stack said. ', u"Andrew Pollack \u2500 the father of 18-year-old victim Meadow, accompanied by his therapy dog Sunny \u2500 said he was determined to be the \u201cface of the last father of a murdered kid.\u201d \u201cWe need to make it that every kid in America, when he goes into a classroom, he knows he's safe,\u201d he said."], 'link': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1392516/trump-stuns-by-embracing-gun-control-as-florida-students-return-to-class', 'heading': u'Trump stuns by embracing gun control as Florida students return to class'}

', u'\u201cPakistan will be assigned to the \u2018grey list\u2019 in June, once an action plan has been mutually negotiated,\u201d FO spokesman Dr Muhammad Faisal said at the weekly media briefing. ', u'It was the first official confirmation that the FATF had at its last plenary session held on Feb 21-23 in Paris decided to place Pakistan in the category of jurisdictions monitored by the FATF\u2019s International Cooperation Review Group, commonly known as the grey list. ', u'The confusion about Pakistan\u2019s status was because the publicly shared outcomes of the FATF remained silent on the country\u2019s nomination for the grey list by the United States, Britain, France and Germany. ', u'Expresses concern over development of drones by India', u'The FO spokesman said Pakistan and the FATF would now mutually negotiate the \u2018action plan\u2019. He rejected a perception that Pakistan would be transferred from the \u2018grey\u2019 to \u2018black\u2019 list in June this year. \u201cThe FATF website clearly demarcates the countries in \u2018black\u2019 list as those who are non-cooperative,\u201d he said. ', u'Pakistan, it is believed, may be considered for black list if it does not cooperate in negotiating the action plan. ', u'Dr Faisal recalled the steps that Pakistan had taken over the past few years to address international concerns. The steps taken by Pakistan included legislation, issuance of regulations and guidelines by the State Bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan to the financial sector, establishment of the Financial Monitoring Unit and implementation of UNSC 1267 sanctions on the entities of concern, specifically Jamaatud Dawa and Falah-i-Insaniyat Foundation. ', u'\u201cWe will take further actions for addressing any remaining deficiencies,\u201d the spokesman underscored. ', u'It is not clear how long it could take Pakistan to get out of the grey list. Similarly, there is an ongoing debate on the implications of listing for Pakistan. It is generally believed that it can affect international banking transactions, investment and cost of doing business in the country. ', u'The FO spokesman, while commenting on the statements coming from US officials, said: \u201cWe continue to get differing signals from different parts of the US government.\u201d ', u'Centcom Commander Gen Votel had in a testimony before a US House of Representatives panel on Tuesday mentioned the \u201cpositive indicators from Pakistan\u201d. ', u'Meanwhile, US National Security Council official Lisa Curtis, who visited Islamabad earlier this week, talked about continuing presence of Haqqani network and other terror sanctuaries on Pakistani soil and the deficiencies in Pakistan\u2019s counter-illicit financing regime. ', u'\u201cPakistan has made immense efforts to address issues related to counterterrorism. We continue to ask the US for actionable evidence,\u201d Dr Faisal said. ', u'He said Ms Curtis\u2019 visit was part of regular and continuous engagement between Pakistan and the US. ', u'\u201cThe main agenda of the meeting of the foreign secretary with Ms Curtis was to exchange views and understand each other\u2019s perspective on how to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan. Both sides have a desire to work together to pursue our common objective of stabilising Afghanistan,\u201d he added. ', u'He also reminded about the bilateral dialogue that was taking place outside the public glare. ', u'The FO spokesman expressed concern over India developing drones. ', u'India had last Sunday tested combat Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Rustom-II. ', u'\u201cIndia\u2019s development of drone technology is worrying when seen in the larger context of its buildup and expansion of military capabilities in the conventional and non-conventional domains, which are subjecting regional strategic stability to increasing strain,\u201d Dr Faisal said. ', u'In reply to a question about the Federal Investigation Agency reaching out to Interpol for issuance of red warrants against former ambassador to the US Hussain Haqqani, he said it was being done on the Supreme Court\u2019s order. ', u'\u201cThe FIA is taking necessary action to implement the directives of the Supreme Court. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will provide whatever assistance it can, as far as coordination with the US authorities is concerned,\u201d he maintained.

In the 2008 election, according to the same study, the number of non-Muslim voters was greater than the difference of votes between winners and runners-up in 59 constituencies. ', u'For non-Muslim voters to have a veto over victory or defeat, however, there has to be 100 per cent voting by them. This is something impossible to achieve, given that mobilisation among them could easily be lower than among Muslim voters because they do not get as much attention from the candidates as Muslims do. ', u'Another reason for a negligible impact of non-Muslim voters on election results is that they are scattered very widely, though their votes number 10,000 or more in 98 National Assembly constituencies. According to estimates in ', u', the Christian population is more than 50,000 in 14 districts. All of them except one \u2013 Karachi \u2013 are in Punjab. Hindus have a population of 50,000 or more in 11 districts. Out of these, 10 districts are in Sindh and just one \u2013 Rahim Yar Khan \u2013 is in Punjab. No district with a large Hindu population also has a sizeable Christian population \u2014 and vice versa. ', u'The net result of these demographics is that non-Muslim candidates seldom have the chance to win a seat contested in a general election. The only non-Muslim to have won in direct popular ballot in the last general election is Mahesh Kumar Malani. He got elected for the Sindh Assembly from a Tharparkar district constituency that has 68,000 non-Muslim voters \u2014 slightly more than half of the 133,254 total registered votes there. Perhaps no other constituency has a vote ratio that similarly favours a non-Muslim candidate. ', u'This situation has led many non-Muslim politicians to find byways to enter the legislature. Some prominent non-Muslim families, for instance, have members in all major political parties. Dr Sham Sunder Advani, president of PMLN\u2019s minority wing in Sindh, has close relatives in both PPP and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). President of the Sindh minority wing of PTI, Jai Parkash Ukrani, former Sindh minister for excise and taxation, Giyan Chand Israni, and PPP\u2019s Sindh minority wing president Lal Chand Ukrani are all related to Advani as well as to each other. ', u'They also come from the same town \u2014 Thano Bula Khan in district Jamshoro, one of the few Hindu-majority areas in Sindh. The place is also known for its high levels of poverty and low levels of development. Its residents face a shortage of drinking water almost throughout the year. ', u'This lack of development, according to many community activists, is partially owed to the electoral system that allows non-Muslim politicians to reach the legislature by indirect means. Anjum Riaz, a resident of Youhanabad and a community activist, calls it a \u201csham\u201d democracy. \u201cNon-Muslim legislators do not have to worry about being accountable to the public,\u201d he says. ', u'Pervez Musharraf introduced the current proportional representation system for religious minorities in 2002. Under this system, except for Ahmadis, non-Muslims can vote and contest elections on general seats but they also have seats reserved for them in the Senate, the National Assembly and the four provincial assemblies. These seats are not filled through direct vote but from lists submitted to the Election Commission of Pakistan by political parties that get these seats in proportion to the number of directly contested general seats they have in a legislative house. To qualify for a reserved seat, a party must have at least five per cent of the general seats. ', u'The National Assembly has 10 reserved seats for non-Muslims. Six of them are occupied by Hindus, three by Christians and one by a Parsee. Three more members of the house \u2013 Phyllis Azeem and Romina Khurshid Alam from Punjab and Reeta Ishwar Lal from Sindh \u2013 are non-Muslims but they have been elected to seats reserved for women. ', u'The Senate has four seats reserved for non-Muslims \u2014 two each going to Hindus and Christians. Another Hindu senator, Gianchand, is elected on a general seat. ', u'The Punjab Assembly has eight reserved seats for non-Muslims. Christians have six of those and Sikhs and scheduled caste Hindus have one each. Three other Christians \u2013 Joyce Rufian Julius, Mary Gill and Shazia Tariq \u2013 have entered the assembly through seats reserved for women. ', u'The Sindh Assembly has nine non-Muslim members on reserved seats \u2014 all except one of them are Hindus. In Balochistan, the provincial assembly has three seats reserved for minorities. Two of them have gone to Christians and one to a Hindu. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly has two non-Muslim members \u2014 both on reserved seats and both Christians. ', u'These numbers hide some small but important details. Among all the legislators on seats reserved for non-Muslims, only two are women \u2014 Asiya Nasir in the National Assembly and Shunila Ruth in the Punjab Assembly. The total number of Hindu legislators is 21 but only three of them come from the scheduled castes. This is in spite of anecdotal evidence that suggests a vast majority of Hindus in Pakistan belong to the scheduled castes. ', u'Census data, however, shows something entirely different: upper-caste Hindus were 1.6 per cent of Pakistan\u2019s total population according to the 1998 census and those from the scheduled castes were only 0.25 per cent. Latest demographic data gathered in the 2017 census has not yet been divided into religious categories but community activists complain there was a massive confusion on how it differentiated between upper-caste and scheduled-caste Hindus at the data collection stage. Many census workers did not know the distinction between the two communities though there were separate columns for them in the census forms. In many places, they were lumped together since their religion is the same, activists allege. The same thing could have happened in previous censuses. ', u'\t\t\t\n', u'The electoral system for non-Muslim Pakistanis suffers from some other problems as well. Upper-caste Hindus, for example, have more influence and money to be able to gain nominations from political parties than those from the scheduled castes who are mostly uneducated and poor, says high court lawyer Arjun Das, who is also general secretary of the Scheduled Castes Federation of Pakistan. ', u'It was for these and some other reasons that veteran Christian politician Julius Salik went to the Supreme Court in 2010 against the proportional electoral system. He stated in his petition that the current system \u201ccan be used by the political parties to introduce such people in the National Assembly who will work under the command of the political parties and will have no concern with the betterment of the minorities\u201d.', u'In its verdict, issued in August 2015, the Supreme Court did not overturn the electoral system but it did say that proportional representation for non-Muslims was against three principles laid down in the Objectives Resolution, which comprises the preamble of the Constitution. The first of these principles promises that \u201cadequate provisions shall be made to safeguard the legitimate interests of minorities\u201d; the second guarantees that \u201cthe State shall exercise its powers and authority through the chosen representatives of the people\u201d; the third states \u201cthat the principles of democracy ... shall be fully observed\u201d. ', u'A delegation of Indian Muslims met British viceroy Lord Minto in 1906. They drew his attention to the fact that Muslims were 14 per cent of the population in the United Provinces but could not secure a single seat in its legislative assembly under a joint electorate system. They then demanded that Muslims be given the status of an electorate separate from other Indians so that they could elect their own representatives. The viceroy agreed. The British Parliament then passed the Indian Councils Act 1909 that gave Muslims the separate electorate they had been asking for. ', u'The Indian National Congress did not accept the change. Pandit Motilal Nehru, a prominent Congress leader, prepared what is known as the Nehru Report on constitutional and electoral reforms on the behalf of an all-parties conference held in August 1928. He suggested going back to a joint electorate. ', u'Muhammad Ali Jinnah issued a rejoinder to Nehru Report in March 1929 \u2014 known as his famous \u2018Fourteen Points\u2019. He said the \u201crepresentation of communal groups should continue to be by means of separate electorates\u201d. ', u'The disagreement between Congress and the Muslim leaders was a recipe for discord, if not conflict \u2014 as shown by three aborted round-table conferences between Indian politicians and their British interlocutors between 1930 and 1932. To break the impasse, British prime minister Ramsay MacDonald issued in August 1932 what is known as the \u201cCommunal Award\u201d. It provided separate electorate status not just for Muslims but also for the Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians, \u201cdepressed classes\u201d, earlier known as \u201cuntouchables\u201d, and Europeans living in India. ', u'Congress saw this as a ploy to divide Indians into various communal groups in general and Hindus into upper castes and depressed classes in particular. Its opposition led to an amendment that assigned some seats to the depressed classes without giving them the right to have an electorate separate from other Hindus. In the 1946 election, members of the central and provincial assemblies were chosen under the same electoral system.', u'The question of non-Muslims living in newly created Pakistan became moot immediately after independence. For Jinnah, it \u201cwas a legally surmountable problem\u201d, wrote Dr Martin Lau, a dean at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, in his 2012 paper, ', u'. Lau quotes Jinnah as saying three months before the independence: \u201cThe minorities of Pakistan will \u2026 enjoy all the rights, privileges and obligations of citizenship without distinction of caste, creed or sect.\u201d', u'Jinnah\u2019s inclusive policy allowed Jogendra Nath Mandal, a scheduled-caste Hindu from East Pakistan, to become the country\u2019s first law minister. The deputy speaker of the Punjab Assembly at the time was a Christian, Fazal Ilahi. His successor, Chaudhry Chandu Lal, was also a Christian. The deputy speaker of the second National Assembly, Cecil Edward Gibbon, too was a Christian. (Today, we cannot imagine any non-Muslim getting such prestigious and powerful positions.) ', u'After Jinnah\u2019s demise, his ideas started facing challenges from within the ruling Muslim League. As Brookings Institution\u2019s Dr Matthew J Nelson wrote in his 2015 paper ', u': \u201cBuilding on the work of a group known as the Pakistan Educational Conference \u2026 which, in late 1947, endorsed an \u2018Ideology of Pakistan\u2019 devoted to the inculcation of Islamic values in a push to counter fears of encroaching \u2018provincialism\u2019 \u2026 the Constituent Assembly began its work with a landmark resolution known as the Objectives Resolution [in March 1949].\u201d', u'Those who supported the Objectives Resolution, next demanded separate electorates. The implicit logic behind the demand was political. ', u'Pakistan\u2019s total population, according to the 1951 census, was 75.64 million. Out of this, 64.96 million were Muslims \u2014 32.73 million of them in West Pakistan and 32.23 million in East Pakistan. The vast majority of the remaining population, about 10.68 million, was of Hindus living mostly in East Pakistan. \u201cIf those Hindus could be sidelined in electoral process through separate electorates, then the western and the eastern wings could be on equal footing as far as Muslim electorates were concerned,\u201d says Tahir Mehdi, a political researcher and analyst.', u'The Constituent Assembly, which had 18 non-Muslims among its 69 members, also set up a 24-member Basic Principles Committee in 1949 to make suggestions for a basic structure of Pakistan\u2019s constitution. In January 1953, Abu A\u2019la Maududi, the founder of Jamaat-e-Islami, and 32 other ulema gathered in Karachi to consider the committee\u2019s report. According to Nelson, Maududi argued at the meeting \u201cthat a religious group known as the Ahmediyya \u2026 should be relegated to a separate list of \u2018non-Muslim\u2019 legislative seats\u201d. (Shortly afterwards, anti-Ahmadi riots erupted throughout Punjab.) ', u'Different religious minorities responded differently to the demand for separate electorates. Christians in West Pakistan supported the idea. Hindus in East Pakistan opposed it. ', u'Christian leaders in Punjab had been supporting separate electorates even before independence. S P Singha, a prominent Lahore-based Christian and the then speaker of the Punjab Assembly, told the Punjab Boundary Commission in July 1947 that joint electorates meant Hindu domination. \u201cNobody outside the [Christian] community can understand the obsession that the community has on this point ... They want separate electorates. It is a question of life and death for them \u2026\u201d he said. ', u'East Pakistani Hindus, on the other hand, were quite vocal against separate electorates. Their logic was the same as advanced by Congress in pre-independence India \u2014 that separate electorates will divide Hindus into upper castes and scheduled castes. Their fears were strengthened when some prominent Muslim legislators argued that scheduled castes were not part of the Hindu community. Sir Zafarullah Khan, the then foreign minister, quoted Hindu scriptures, especially Manusmriti, to state that upper-caste \u201cHindus and scheduled-caste, depressed classes were religiously separate entities \u2026\u201d (He would have not known that his talk of intra-religion divisions will come to haunt his own Ahmadi community two decades later.) ', u' Hindu legislators responded by saying that \u2018untouchables\u2019 or \u2018scheduled castes\u2019 were \u201can integral part of the great Hindu community\u201d. Prem Hari Barma from East Pakistan, one of the four scheduled-caste parliamentarians, said on October 14, 1953 on the floor of the Constituent Assembly that scheduled castes \u201cwant joint electorate\u201d though \u201cwith reservation of seats for them on population basis\u201d. ', u'The other objection that Hindus raised against separate electorates was that these negated equality among citizens. Sris Chandra Chattopadhyaya, a Hindu member of the Constituent Assembly said that accepting separate electorates was like accepting the status of \u201czimmi\u201d, \u201cpariah\u201d and \u201coutlaw\u201d. ', u'The issue remained unresolved. The 1956 Constitution left it to the incoming Parliament to decide after ascertaining \u201cthe views of the Provincial Assemblies\u201d. In its October 1956 session, held in Dhaka, the National Assembly approved joint electorate for East Pakistan and separate electorate for West Pakistan. ', u'\t\t\t\n', u'Christian leaders from Punjab \u2013 Cecil Edward Gibbon, S P Singha, Chaudhry Chandu Lal, Sunder Daas and Joshua Fazlud Din \u2013 filed a constitutional petition before the (West Pakistan) High Court stating that the Constituent Assembly could not approve two electorate systems for two parts of the country. The judges dismissed the petition, declaring that Parliament was sovereign in forming and modifying the constitution. ', u'Fazlud Din wrote a book, ', u', around the same time. The preface of the book, published in 1956, was written by none other than Maududi. Fazlud Din argued: \u201cThe very fact that the non-Muslim minorities are to enjoy full religious freedom and the right to develop their culture should leave us in no manner of doubt that these rights can be enjoyed in the real sense only when the minorities are also given full freedom to elect their representatives \u2026\u201d', u'The author also did not agree with the suggestion that reserving representation for minorities should be used only as an act of positive discrimination that would be abolished once social and economic equality was achieved. The reserved seats, according to him, were always needed to maintain segregation between Muslims and non-Muslims in keeping with the Two Nation Theory that had resulted in the separation of Muslim Pakistan from the rest of India. ', u'On February 17, 1960, Ayub Khan appointed an 11-member commission, headed by a former chief justice of Pakistan, Sir Shahabuddin, to probe, among other things, whether a joint or separate electorate suited the country. Its members claimed the demand for a joint electorate was a manifestation of the desire among upper-caste Hindus to merge with the majority and influence the ideology of Pakistan. \u201cTheir demand for a joint electorate seems clearly to be for some ulterior purpose other than the welfare of Pakistan,\u201d they noted. ', u'But Ayub Khan dismissed the commission\u2019s recommendation for separate electorates. When he introduced basic democracies for local government, elections for them were held on the basis of a joint electorate. The same system was used for the 1970 general election. ', u'The 1973 Constitution, too, originally envisaged a joint electorate but anti-Ahmadi riots, which happened all over Punjab from May to October in 1974, occasioned the Second Constitutional Amendment that declared Ahmadis as non-Muslims, thus necessitating changes for their political representation separate from Muslims. Six reserved seats were subsequently created for non-Muslims through the Fourth Constitutional Amendment in November 1975, making the National Assembly their electoral college. ', u'After General Ziaul Haq took over power in 1977, he made the next move. In September 1978, he amended election laws to create separate electoral rolls for Muslims and non-Muslims. \u201cThe separate electorates made it necessary to include a declaration of faith in the application for voter registration,\u201d noted The Pakistan Election Compendium compiled by Tahir Mehdi. ', u'On March 2, 1985, Zia increased the National Assembly seats reserved for non-Muslims from 6 to 10: four seats for Hindus, four for Christians, one for Ahmadis and one for other non-Muslim communities. He also reserved seats for them in the provincial assemblies: Punjab was to have five seats for Christians, one for Hindus, one for Ahmadis and one for other non-Muslim communities; Balochistan was to have one reserved seat each for Christians, Hindus and other minorities; the North-West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhawa) was also to have one seat each for Christians, Ahmadis and other minorities and Sindh was to have two seats reserved for Christians, five for upper-caste Hindus, one for Ahmadis and one for other minorities. (When another general, Pervez Musharraf, abolished separate electorates in 2002, he maintained the same number of reserved seats for the minorities though their allocation was changed a little.) ', u'The election to these reserved seats was to take place at polling booths. The whole of Pakistan served as a single constituency for the National Assembly seats reserved for each community. Each province was a single constituency for reserved seats in the respective provincial assembly. ', u'The general elections of 1985, 1988, 1990, 1993 and 1997 were all held under this system that gave the church and the clergy an undue advantage. Non-clergy candidates had no mechanism to reach out to their voters spread all over Pakistan. Priests, on the other hand, could mobilise support through church networks and religious associations. This explains why Ruffian Julius, a Catholic priest from Gujranwala, secured the highest number of votes among all non-Muslim candidates for a National Assembly seat in 1988. ', u'But what worked for the clergy does not seem to have worked for the minorities in general. In a damning study, ', u', Rawalpindi-based Christian Study Centre pointed out that separate electorates sharpened the minority-majority divide, decreased interest for electoral politics among the minorities, allowed hatred against non-Muslims to spread and led to the misuse of discriminatory laws against them. Those elected through this system, the report said, would always \u201cgo along with the ruling party or coalition unquestionably and unimaginatively \u2026 thus, the very purpose of minority representation was undone\u201d.', u'West Pakistan\u2019s total population in 1951 was 33.70 million of which Muslims were 32.73 million (97.1 per cent). Upper-caste Hindus were 162,000 (0.4 per cent); scheduled-caste Hindus were 369,000 (1.09 per cent); Christians were 434,000 (1.2 per cent) and members of other religious communities numbered 7,000. The 1998 census showed that the share of non-Muslims in the total population had, indeed, increased to 3.72 per cent over the five previous decades, showing a gain of 1.82 per cent. The population of Christians alone had increased from 1.2 per cent to 1.59 per cent. There had been an even bigger jump in the upper-caste Hindu population \u2014 from 0.4 per cent in 1951 to 1.6 per cent in 1998. ', u'Going by these figures, non-Muslim Pakistanis still have about half a per cent less representation in all the legislative houses combined than their population share demands. That, however, is a minor issue. ', u'For one, the current system skews the development process against non-Muslim Pakistanis, as has been shown at the beginning of this article. Their legislative representatives have also failed to make a concerted effort to get a formal status for katchi abadis or irregular settlements where a large number of non-Muslims live. A few of these settlements were formalised and their residents were given land rights in 1988 when Benazir Bhutto first became prime minister. Since then, only once has this issue been raised again \u2013 this time by PMLN \u2013 for the formalisation of a katchi abadi next to the Forman Christian College, Lahore. A final decision about it, however, is still pending. ', u'\t\t\t\n', u'Implementation of the five per cent minority quota in government jobs is a similarly neglected area. The annual statistical bulletin of federal government employees for 2010-11 states that only 2.6 per cent or 11,521 federal jobs \u2013 out of a total of 449,964 \u2013 were held by non-Muslims. About 70 per cent of these jobs fell in the two lowest grades. No non-Muslims held a job in the highest grade. ', u'The contribution of non-Muslim legislators in reforming their respective communities\u2019 personal laws is also negative, if any at all. ', u'Rana Chandar Singh, an upper-caste Hindu who had been a member of the National Assembly multiple times before his death in 2009, fiercely resisted any move to provide a legal mechanism for the dissolution of a Hindu marriage. Now there are two laws governing Hindu marriages \u2014 one enacted by the federal government on February 8, 2016 and the other by the Sindh government, promulgated a week later. They, however, seem to be working on cross-purposes. \u201cThe entire purpose of Sindh\u2019s law is to fail the federal law that contains a divorce clause which is not acceptable to most Hindu legislators,\u201d says Shahid Jatoi, a researcher on governance and the rule of law.', u'Most Christian legislators, similarly, oppose changes in the Christian Divorce Act 1869. Zia struck down Section 7 of this law in 1981, making dissolution of a Christian marriage next to impossible. The result is that many Christian couples convert to Islam to dissolve their marriages. In countless other cases, women have been forced to stay in abusive marriages that sometimes cost them their lives. ', u'When the Lahore High Court called Punjab\u2019s Minister for Human Rights and Minority Affairs, Tahir Khalil Sindhu, in January 2017 to explain his stance on the divorce act, he argued that a marriage was a sacred tie that could only be dissolved on the grounds of adultery. In the same hearing, the then federal human rights minister Kamran Michael told the court that \u201creligious injunctions could not be changed to serve fundamental human rights\u201d.', u'The critics say these legislators are so dependent on priests for political support that they can never oppose the religious establishment. \u201cThey have no roots within their communities,\u201d says Riaz Anjum. \u201cWhen they are required to show public support to their party leadership, they show religious gatherings, not political ones.\u201d ', u'Mainstream political parties and policymakers, too, do not seem to take non-Muslim legislators seriously. They were not made part of parliamentary negotiations that led to the passage of the 18th Constitutional Amendment back in 2009-10. They were also not invited to high level meetings in early 2015 when the National Action Plan against extremism and terrorism was firmed up. The recently passed electoral reform laws have no input from them. Two Christian members of the National Assembly \u2013 Asiya Nasir and Tariq C Qaiser \u2013 were invited only as observers in 2015 to the consultations for electoral reforms. Their recommendations, however, were brushed aside. ', u'When Musharraf decided to hold general elections in 2002, his law minister Dr Khalid Ranjha advocated a joint electorate. His suggestion was accepted. ', u'Many Christian community leaders did not like it. \u201cThe religious leadership of Christians became very active in lobbying at various platforms, arguing that they could not come to Parliament through a joint electorate system because no one would want to vote for a Christian,\u201d says Ranjha. So the system was changed again \u2014 retaining joint electorate but giving non-Muslims reserved seats in all houses of the legislature. ', u'This dual system, however, has not ended the differences over political representation of non-Muslim Pakistanis. Some favour the current system. \u201cNow the problems of our minority communities are resolved within their own constituencies and then they also have minority parliamentarians as a backup,\u201d is how Mukesh Kumar Chawla, an upper-caste Hindu and a provincial minister in Sindh, views it. ', u'His PTI counterparts also want no change except that political parties nominate better candidates who, says Ramesh Singh Arora, a Sikh member of the Punjab Assembly, should be educated, politically trained and aware of human rights. ', u'The National Assembly\u2019s lone Parsee member, Isphanyar M Bhandara, also argues it is the performance of a legislator that counts the most, not the way he or she is elected. \u201cWhat is the guarantee that those who are elected through a direct vote would serve their people with selflessness and integrity?\u201d he says. ', u'Yet many among the minorities want their representatives chosen directly by them even if that means the restoration of separate electorates. Others argue that non-Muslims should have a double-vote \u2014 they cast one for a general seat candidate and the other for a non-Muslim candidate. ', u'Sarwar Bari, general secretary of the Free and Fair Election Network, a conglomerate of civil society organisations, also supports a dual vote for non-Muslims. \u201cNon-Muslim voters should have double votes in at least 24 National Assembly constituencies where their vote is 25,000 or more,\u201d he argues.', u'This system may work in districts where the population of non-Muslims is high but it will be difficult to implement in areas where their population is thin and scattered. It runs the risk of disenfranchising a huge number of non-Muslim voters living in constituencies where their votes are not sizeable. ', u'Peter Jacob, executive director of the Centre for Social Justice, a civil rights organisation based in Lahore, offers another solution. He wants political parties to hold internal elections to decide their nominees for reserved seats. This will make the nomination process transparent, he says, and remove the perception that non-Muslim legislators are only hand-picked by their party bosses. Elections held within parties, though, are yet to establish their credibility as we have seen in several aborted PTI attempts to elect its officials.', u'Tahir Mehdi does not agree with any of this. He wants reserved seats abolished altogether. \u201cAny representation system based on religion will strengthen [the] minority-majority divide and will lead to a separate electorate system,\u201d he says. He suggests that political parties should be made more inclusive by law. \u201cThey should be made to have more non-Muslims at their top posts and their general election candidates should also include a sufficient number of non-Muslims.\u201d ', u'As Bari puts it, religious harmony will improve only when Muslims elect a non-Muslim.

After promulgation of the ordinance, the Punjab government has taken control of several institutions being run by banned outfits.

Restraining the provincial government from passing laws or orders was against the sanctity of parliament, he argued. ', u'At this, the chief justice observed that in case the counsel insisted on this point, the court would have to hear all the provinces otherwise its judgement would prejudice their rights. He said he might have to constitute a larger bench so that judges from other three provinces could also be part of the bench to hear and settle the matter. ', u'The court then issued a notice to the attorney general and adjourned the hearing to March 7.

In his response to the demand, Finance Minister Rana Afzal said the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) had recommended 31 per cent increase in the petroleum prices but the government raised between four to nine per cent only. The government was still bearing Rs4.2 billion subsidy on petroleum products, he said, explaining that the petroleum prices in Pakistan were still lower than those in neighbouring countries.

{'date': u'March 03, 2018', 'text': [u'ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court observed on Friday that holding a disqualified person to be a king amounted to giving him a freehand to operate as a kingmaker. ', u'\u201cAnd such a person despite lacking qualification and without going through the electoral process acts as a puppet master who pulls strings and exercises political power vicariously,\u201d the court said in a detailed judgement explaining reasons why former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had been debarred from heading the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz on Feb 21. ', u'The judgement was issued on a set of petitions moved by a number of political parties and citizens, including Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chief Imran Khan, Awami Muslim League Sheikh Rashid and the Pakistan Peoples Party. ', u'CJP explains reasons for barring Sharif from heading PML-N', u'\u201cAllowing a disqualified person to act as party president will be a mockery of the Constitution, the legislative process, the law, the government and values that we hold so dear and have consciously worked for, defended and incorporated in the Constitution,\u201d said the 51-page verdict, authored by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar. ', u'It explained that the underlying theme and focus of the Constitution were to ensure that only those individuals entered the electoral process who fulfilled the prerequisites and requirements spelt out in the Constitution itself to be worthy delegates of Almighty Allah to work for the welfare of the people of Pakistan. ', u'The Supreme Court, however, made it clear that it would refrain from striking down Section 203 of the Elections Act, 2017 \u2014 which allows a disqualified person to head a political party. The reason it explained, was the court\u2019s interpretation of the section in the light of Articles 62, 63 and 63A of the Constitution, which harmonised it with the general scheme, theme and jurisprudential architecture of the Constitution. ', u'The judgement said: \u201cCandidates who wish to offer themselves through election to the parliament or the provincial assemblies play a fundamentally important role. In most instances following the modern democratic norms and remaining within the framework and underlying theme of the Constitution, they form themselves into the political parties. ', u'\u201cThus the political parties are vehicles which provide intending candidates the means and the roadmap to reach the destination of membership of the legislature and thereafter a possible chance of being a part of the government formed by the party which enjoys the maximum number of seats in the parliament.\u201d ', u'Referring to party heads, the judgement explained that it would be absurd and illogical to hold that the party head who virtually controlled and held in his hands the fate and prospects of members of his party holding parliamentary or other public office who fulfilled the requirements of Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution, yet he needed not meet the requirements of these provisions himself. ', u'\u201cSuch an interpretation will not only be contrary to and in conflict with the entire scheme, focus and theme of the constitution but will also defeat the very purpose of inserting Articles 62 and 63 in the Constitution,\u201d it said. ', u'The verdict explained that the party head enjoyed the power to impose disciplinary punishment as well as exonerate and thus virtually controlled the parliamentary party which was evident from the power available to him under Article 63A of the Constitution. ', u'The judgement said: \u201cThe provisions of Sections 209, 210 and 216 and the general scheme of the Elections Act also substantiate, reinforce and buttress the finding that the party head wields decisive and controlling powers within his party. ', u'\u201cThus the party head directly controls fundamental matters like the formation of the government, appointment of the prime minister, federal ministers, ministers of state, advisers, chief ministers, provincial ministers, provincial advisers, governors, president, the mode and manner in which members of his party would vote in matters that come before the parliament and the Senate or the provincial assemblies. ', u'\u201cThe argument that a party head can exist beyond the ambit, purview and scope of the constitutional and legal framework within which he operates if accepted would lead to illogical and unreasonable results which are not visualised or intended by the framers of the Constitution. ', u'\u201cMoreover, Article 63-A has been inserted in the Constitution to regulate working of parliamentary parties of political parties represented in the parliament. To assert that Article 63-A has no nexus, link or connection with Article 17 of the Constitution which furnishes the very basis to form and join political parties, is not only illogical but also irrational and untenable.\u201d ', u'The verdict also declared well founded the arguments by the petitioners that Sections 203 and 232 of the Elections Act in their existing form had been inserted to favour and benefit one particular individual or in any case, a limited set of politicians who had been or might be disqualified from holding public office in terms of Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution. ', u'\u201cWe get the distinct impression that a conscious effort has been made to protect, shield, cushion and favour a limited set of individuals to save them from the consequences of disqualification arising out of Articles 62 and 63,\u201d it added. ', u'The judgment said that if Sections 203 and 232 of the Elections Act were to be read independent of the constitutional provisions, it would open the door for political parties being run and controlled remotely and the legislature being dictated and controlled vicariously by persons who had clearly and unambiguously been barred and prohibited by the Constitution from being a part of the parliamentary, legislative and political process. ', u'Thus the appointment of Nawaz Sharif as the president/party head of the PML-N on Oct 3, 2017 immediately after the enactment of the Elections Act was patently illegal as he suffered from a disqualification to hold the position of the party head, the judgement concluded.

', u'The commerce ministry believes that the Turkish government is under an obligation to extend GSP+ status to Pakistan because the former is a member of the EU customs union, a demand that was first presented to the Turkish authorities in 2014. It was in response to this demand that the Turkish government proposed an FTA instead, talks for which were launched the following year. ', u'In the seventh round of FTA talks in June 2017, Pakistan asked either for an extension of GSP+ status by Turkey or for the two countries to grant tariff concessions to each other, extending the lowest tariff that they may have granted to any other country under any FTA. For its part, the Turkish side, according to a source from the Pakistani team present at the meeting, proposed a 25pc reduction in the additional duties imposed in 2011, with the reductions spread over a five-year period and some of the duties possibly phasing out over 11 years.

', u'Another attempt was made to achieve a breakthrough on the sidelines of the WTO ministerial meeting later that month in Buenos Aires, Argentina, again without any success. In fact at that event no meeting between the Pakistani and Turkish trade delegations could take place. ', u'The FTA talks between Pakistan and Turkey have been extended twice. Originally they were supposed to conclude in 2016, but the date was extended to May 2017.  ', u'At present, no further meetings are scheduled, and the commerce ministry has formally asked the cabinet for permission to take up the Turkish refusal to either reduce its additional duties or extend GSP+ status in line with the EU, with the WTO, thereby elevating the issue to a trade dispute between the two countries.'], 'link': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1392850/pakistans-free-trade-agreement-talks-with-turkey-nearing-collapse', 'heading': u"Pakistan's free trade agreement talks with Turkey nearing collapse"}

', u'The lawyer said Sara was questioned under police caution, indicating that she could become a suspect.

Israeli media have reported that he has agreed to turn state\u2019s witness. ', u'As reports of the police interviews emerged, protesters gathered outside the prime minister\u2019s residence, demanding he step down. ', u'\u201cWe want to see Netanyahu go to trial and, if needed, go to jail or go home. Let our people go free from all the corruption surrounding the government and the head of it,\u201d said Shimrit Orr, 72, a writer, from Tel Aviv. ', u'There were a few dozen protesters, singing songs and banging plastic pipes on garbage cans. Some cars beeped their horns in support as they drove by. ', u'\u201cA prime minister under investigation cannot, and may not, take crucial decisions, said Shuki Cohen, 63, an economist from Moshav Arugot. The right-wing prime minister has been Israel\u2019s dominant political figure for a generation, in power since 2009 and for 12 years in total since 1996. He says that he has done nothing wrong, and has said that he will seek a fifth term in an election due in late 2019. ', u'In the two other cases in which police have already recommended that Netanyahu be charged, the final decision about whether or not to prosecute rests with the Israeli attorney general. That decision could be weeks or months away. ', u'In one of the investigations, known as Case 1000, he is suspected of taking gifts worth nearly $300,000 from wealthy businessmen. ', u'The other, Case 2000, involves an alleged plot to win positive coverage in Israel\u2019s biggest newspaper by offering to take measures to curtail the circulation of a rival daily. ', u'So far, partners in Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition have stood by him, saying they are awaiting the attorney-general\u2019s next moves. Political analysts say such support could erode if the investigations against Netanyahu intensify. ', u'Netanyahu could also call a snap election to try to stall legal proceedings during the campaign and rally his rightwing power base behind him. Recent polls show Netanyahu\u2019s Likud ahead of other factions in the Knesset. However, surveys also show that about half of Israelis believe the police over Netanyahu and think he should step down. A third think he should remain in office.'], 'link': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1392843/police-grill-israeli-pm-wife-in-corruption-case', 'heading': u'Police grill Israeli PM, wife in corruption case'}

{'date': u' March 04, 2018', 'text': [u'ISLAMABAD: Encoura\xadged by the results of Saturday\u2019s Senate elections, the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) is now hopeful of getting the key office of Senate chairman with the support of its allies. ', u'However, a group of 15 independents \u2014 seven from Balochistan and eight from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas \u2014 can play a significant role in the coming election for the offices of Senate chairman and deputy chairman. Political experts foresee more political manoeuvrings and use of money in the coming days. ', u'Besides the independents, the support of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) \u2014 which has now become the third largest party in the Senate \u2014 has also become crucial for both the PPP and the PML-N. It will be interesting to see what strategy is adopted by the PTI. As chances of the PTI supporting the PML-N are almost non-existent, political experts believe that the former may not be in a position to announce its support for the PPP either, due to open and harsh criticism of the party by PTI chairman Imran Khan. ', u'The PML-N and its allies, including Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl, Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party, National Party and PML-Functional, will have 48 members in the new Senate that will emerge after March 12 whereas the PPP and the remaining opposition parties will have 40 members. ', u'Independents likely to play a crucial role in elections of chairman, deputy chairman of upper house of parliament', u'When contacted, a senior PML-N leader expressed the hope that the party would manage to get the support of at least six independents and five Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) senators, thus making it easier for the PML-N to get the office of Senate chairman. With the support of the MQM-P and a few independents, he said, the PML-N would easily cross the 60 mark in the upper house. ', u'The PML-N leader said the party was ready to offer the office of deputy chairman to any other party for which negotiations were expected to start in a few days. ', u'On the other hand, despite getting more than expected seats in the Senate elections, the PPP will now have to work hard to woo the smaller parties and groups, if it wants to retain the office of Senate chairman for the next three years. ', u'Political experts believe that to achieve this objective, the PPP leadership has no choice but to nominate incumbent chairman Raza Rabbani again for the slot. Otherwise, they say, the PPP might not get support from the other parties, including the MQM-P and the PTI. ', u'Sources in the PPP told Dawn that Mr Rabbani had not been in good books of party co-chairman Asif Zardari and this time, he was not in a mood to nominate him for the office. ', u'According to the PPP leaders, Mr Zardari during the recent party meetings had discussed the names of Sherry Rehman and Salim Mandviwala for the top Senate office. Besides them, former Senate chairman Farooq Naek and former interior minister Rehman Malik are also among Mr Zardari\u2019s favourites. ', u'On the other hand, the sources claimed that Mr Rabbani enjoyed support of party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and if the young chairman was authorised to nominate the candidate, Mr Rabbani had brighter chances of being nominated again. ', u'Interestingly, there is a group within the PML-N \u2014 though in minority \u2014 which believes that in the current situation of political polarisation in the country due to the ongoing confrontation between the ruling party and the establishment, Mr Rabbani is the most appropriate person for the office of Senate chairman. ', u'A senior PPP leader said though it seemed an ideal situation that the PPP and the PML-N develop an understanding to avoid getting blackmailed from the smaller parties and independents, it seemed highly unlikely because the PPP could face its backlash, particularly in Punjab, in the coming general elections. ', u'The PPP leader said the party was almost facing a revolt in Punjab due to the past policy of supporting the PML-N during the PTI-Pakistan Awami Tehreek sit-in and it was only after the Panama Papers case verdict that the PPP had changed its policy. ', u'\u201cWe had been dubbed friendly opposition and people used to say that the country\u2019s largest two parties had done a \u2018muk muka\u2019 (covert understanding). And if the two parties enter into any agreement on issue of Senate chairman and deputy chairman, the PPP may have to face its repercussions in the general elections,\u201d said the party leader, who is believed to be a close confidant of Mr Zardari. ', u'\u201cWe have support of required members in the 104-member Senate and, therefore, I hope we will not face any difficulty in getting our man elected as the chairman,\u201d said PML-N information secretary Mushahidullah Khan. ', u'He said despite all odds, the results of the elections were exactly up to their expectations. He said the PML-N had contested the elections against the establishment which had given a free hand to the PPP and the PTI in the polls. The change of government in Balochistan and the victory of six independents from the province, he said, were clear proof how the establishment provided an opportunity to Mr Zardari to play his role in Balochistan. ', u'Similarly, Mr Khan also expressed his surprise over the PPP\u2019s victory in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa which, according to him, was not possible without a \u201cPPP-PTI nexus.\u201d ', u'However, he said, the PML-N was ready to talk to every party, including the PPP and the PTI, to seek cooperation in the coming elections of Senate chairman and deputy chairman. ', u'When contacted, PPP spokesman Farhatullah Babar said that his party had not so far finalised any candidates for the offices of Senate chairman and deputy chairman and all names being circulated in media circles were \u201cspeculations.\u201d ', u'He said the party would analyse the Senate results after which they would devise a strategy for elections of the chairman and deputy chairman.'], 'link': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1393082/buoyed-by-win-sharifs-party-eyes-top-senate-post', 'heading': u'Buoyed by win, Sharif\u2019s party eyes top Senate post'}

The State Council Information Office, the Chinese government\u2019s information arm, did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment from Reuters.', u'Strategies on how best to navigate the latest upheaval range from focusing on top executives\u2019 political connections to analysing debt levels and the growth potential of the companies involved.', u'\u201cIt\u2019s taken that if you are a major Chinese company, in all likelihood, there is significant government influence,\u201d said Edward Mermelstein, a partner at Rheem, Bell & Mermelstein in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of to what extent is there significant government influence.\u201d ', u'A Hong Kong-based M&A banker at a global investment bank said, \u201cIt will be just another reason for foreign sell-side folks to be very suspicious of major Chinese acquisitions, yet another hurdle that the Chinese firms will need to go across.\u201d ', u'Companies who appear to have Beijing\u2019s backing include the carmaker Geely and, Fosun, another conglomerate with a one-time penchant for flashy deals, including a stake in Cirque du Soleil.', u'Geely last week stunned Daimler with its sudden acquisition of a $9bnss, 9.7pc stake in the German owner of Mercedes-Benz.', u'Meanwhile, Fosun has in the past week snapped up two European fashion labels and taken control of a Brazilian broker in deals worth a combined $245 million.', u'Differentiating Dealmakers Beijing first put dealmaking conglomerates on notice last summer with a crackdown on their access to credit in the mainland and an edict barring \u201cirrational\u201d investments.', u'Since then, groups including Dalian Wanda and HNA Group have scrambled to ease the resulting cash crunch by offloading assets and changing business models while also pursuing more Beijing-friendly investment strategies.', u'Many bankers and other deal advisers are now pointing to the differences in financing style and even ambition as a way of distinguishing between groups who are in or out of favour.', u'Anbang, for example, has long been considered a quixotic dealmaker \u2014 its best-known asset is the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York. Its financing too has been questioned because much of it came from selling illiquid insurance and savings products, many with shadow banking links, to small investors, according to several regulatory and insurance industry insiders.', u'That sort of activity has been a particular focus of Chinese authorities worried about risks in the financial system.', u'\u201cAnbang was an exception on a few fronts.\u201d said one western bank\u2019s China M&A head. \u201cThey were regulated, they were obviously too high profile for their own good, they were buying things the government doesn\u2019t necessarily favour like hotels and property.\u201d CEFC also transformed rapidly from a niche fuel trader into an oil and finance conglomerate, with an ambition to become an energy giant to rival China\u2019s state-owned behemoths. Ye Jianming, CEFC\u2019s chairman and founder, also had a high profile outside his homeland.', u'In 2016, Ye ranked above French President Emmanuel Macron in Fortune magazine\u2019s \u201840 Under 40\u2019 list of the world\u2019s most influential young people and in 2015, he was appointed an advisor to the Czech president on economic policies.', u'CEFC\u2019s overseas holdings include property, a brewer, a football stadium and an airline.

This week, Fosun\u2019s chairman, Guo Guangchang, told the Financial Times that he planned more overseas deals and that his company\u2019s acquisitions were approved by the Chinese government.', u'He told the newspaper: \u201cThe Chinese government is very law oriented so they support the companies who respect the law.\u201d HNA and Geely declined to comment, and Fosun did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

{'date': u' ', 'text': [u'\t\t\t\n', u'The Pakistani art scene is buzzing with new voices. Young artists are not only breaking new ground with their art, they are also taking older forms and reimagining and reinventing them. Salman Toor and Komail Aijazuddin are both at the vanguard of this latest spur of activity and experimentation in Pakistani art. Raised in Lahore, both were together at the iconic Aitchison College, before going to the United States for higher studies. Their education and training abroad has helped them look critically at the local art tradition and bring in influences and practices that are only adding to the variety of artwork coming out of Pakistan.', u'The two painters are heavily focused on painting human figures in their work, but from two different perspectives. If one is rendering idealised characters, the other is twisting the real to make it look both grotesque and relatable. The ', u' asked Toor and Aijazuddin to sit down together recently to discuss various issues regarding their own art practice in particular and Pakistani art in general. The excerpts follow.', u' Let\u2019s start with what projects you are currently working on? ', u' I am working on a project for Lahore Biennale. It\u2019s going to be more than a painting \u2014 an object-based collage. That is what I usually try to do in a public show. I push myself and create something different. I will be having a show at Aicon Gallery [in New York] later this year. What about you?', u' I have a show coming up in March at Studio O in Lahore and also trying to work with the Lahore Biennale to create a public sculpture. One thing about doing something like public art is that it is so much bigger than one\u2019s usual scale. ', u' Yes! It has to be exciting and it has to be experimental. A little bit crazy. Also you have to screw it up a little bit. But it is very different than working for a show in your studio.', u' A lot of people don\u2019t know a lot about the daily life of an artist. I know that before I turned towards creating art as a day job, I was very sceptical of making a living through it. Was there a point for you when it stopped being a hobby and turned into a profession? ', u' Yes. When I decided or when I was told that I was going to be on my own financially, it did make a huge difference. I really had to work like I never had before. I was never forced to do it [before]. ', u' Contrary to popular belief, working as an artist is a job. I find I have to treat it that way otherwise it can take over too much of my life. What about you?', u' Totally, it\u2019s a job but it\u2019s also playtime. There is a sense of play that I feel while painting. I can\u2019t let it get corrupted by pressure or by [what] people experience [while working] in an office. ', u'\t\t\t\n', u' I remember your work on class structures and servant quarters. Even in your most recent show at [Karachi\u2019s] Canvas Gallery, many of the paintings were about the tensions between economic classes \u2014 the way they have interacted historically. Were you conscious of this class conflict when you were working on those paintings? ', u' It started as a conscious project in 2014 when I had a show called Close Quarters at Canvas Gallery. I was, however, unconscious of it when [I was working for my show] called Short Stories that happened in 2017. [Paintings in the latter show resulted from] the way of looking that I have developed. I tried to encapsulate locally produced literature, mostly English fiction, in those paintings. I wanted to translate fiction into the picturesque. Are you conscious of themes in your work?', u' In a sense. [My work] primarily deals with ideas like blasphemy and religious iconography. When I think about producing a work \u2013 here or anywhere \u2013 it usually always starts by thinking about faith and what [faith] represents. My work originates from a conscious decision to engage with these ideas, to figure out the ways people consider faith to be of paramount importance, particularly in Pakistan. What is your faith; where it comes from; how you practice it; what does it look like when you practice it? You are always aware of these questions even when they are only implied [in your day-to-day life]. ', u'They are more than caricatures. The types of people that I use in my work are character actors. They are tools to capture characters [found] in literary fiction.', u' I think the majority [of people] largely just assume what their faith is. [Maybe you think otherwise] because your point of view differs from theirs. ', u' I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about individual beliefs; it\u2019s mainly just about asking questions or talking about faith. It\u2019s not really about convincing [others of my point-of-view].', u' There is a lot of red and gold in your paintings. These colours are so bridal. How did you come to use them? ', u' Yes, I suppose they are very bridal! It goes back to my interest in religious art. A lot of religious art \u2013 through the Byzantine times [to the 21st century] \u2013 uses valuable materials. People have always held [their faith] very dearly to them so they have used a lot of gold [in religious iconography] because that was the most expensive material around. I found out that using gold was the most immediate way to connect a contemporary art viewer with historical religious iconography that I wanted to talk about.', u'The red came in by mistake. When you put gold leaf onto a surface, you are encouraged to paint the surface red first so that it looks warm to offset gold which is usually thin and cooler. When I was in graduate school, one day one of my professors came in [to the studio] when [one of my] portraits was at the red stage. It was yet to be painted. He said, \u201cOh, I really like that\u201d and I suddenly started considering my unfinished work to be complete. I have found that the limited colour palette allows me room to manoeuvre. ', u' A lot of human figures you have painted are very regal. They are perfect and beautiful and they are young too. Is that deliberate?', u' Yes. The idealisation of my figures probably has a lot to do with my interest in Greek and Roman art that I studied at the undergraduate level. It also has its origin in the idea that when you are talking about religion, you have to use perfection as an ideal. ', u'The subjects of my painting are also not meant to be real people. I use gold leaf in my paintings [because I want to create] the light of divinity around my subjects. Their imperfections, therefore, disappear and they become the most idealised version of themselves because they are, literally, not of this world. It\u2019s also a lot easier to paint a perfect figure than an imperfect one. ', u'\t\t\t\n', u'Conversely, your recent work highlights aspects that make your human subjects imperfect. Like when you paint their pimples or the dirt underneath their fingernails. You are interested in making them grotesque in a way. They are not just real, worldly, but in some cases they have elements of caricature. Do you agree? ', u' They are more than caricatures. The types of people that I use in my work are character actors. They are tools to capture characters [found] in literary fiction. I want to create local types of people who are recognisable to, for example, my household servant and to myself so that both kinds of viewers look at the painting and love it. There were lots of servants of my house in a painting that [recently went] to a show. They found [their depictions] really funny. I found their reaction to be one of the most rewarding things \u2014 as if everyone was involved in [making the painting]. ', u'Blemishes are lovely because they give you a chance to paint them. In a strange sense, pimples can be very sensual in paintings. They are sort of a sculpture on the skin. They give a weird kind of profile to a particular kind of person. They are in a way the polar opposite to how you depict figures.', u' [Mine show] the idea of reverence and [that is why I make them] as perfect, other-worldly individuals. That contrast between us is highly interesting because you were the only other figurative painter for the longest time that I could look towards in our generation. There weren\u2019t many doing the kind of work that we do. That\u2019s a pity because I always wanted more people [to be doing figurative art]. ', u'I envy a lot of people who went to the NCA [National College of Arts, Lahore], particularly to its miniature department because they all worked within the same [artistic] vocabulary [of miniatures]. When one of them pushed the vocabulary slightly further, it worked to the benefit of every other artist because then they could move it even further. This has not always been the case with contemporary figurative Pakistani art. You or I may look towards the works of Colin David or Shakir Ali or Ijaz ul Hassan as well as to that of those who did fantastic figurative work in the 1980s. I wish there had been more people doing figurative art since then, as has been the case with neo-miniature. ', u'Do you look towards the works of other Pakistani artists as far as painting figures is concerned? ', u'\t\t\t\n', u' Not to contemporary ones. A lot of inspiration for the things I create comes from my way of looking. I have internalised a vocabulary. I feel like I am just catching scenes all the time. I am always looking at the arrangements of people: what they are wearing, how they are talking; how I can use them for picture-making. It\u2019s called tableau vivant which is like a cluster of very beautifully arranged costume figures. It sounds like a very outlandish or stupid kind of thing to do in today\u2019s world. ', u' Did you ever feel the need to justify your focus on human figure? ', u' It isn\u2019t justifiable. The West has had a trail of vivid [human] imagery for such a long time, the museums there are so overloaded with grand, great works, that I can see why people there are not crazy about going back [in art history] or revisiting it. I consider myself separate from that [tradition]. I feel like I have a [duty] to consider all that as exotic and absorb it [in my work].', u' Why do you find the approach to the human figure in Pakistani art different from that in the West? ', u' Because our South Asian art approached the figure through miniature painting which is very different \u2014 a tradition of family albums or heirlooms for private viewing only. ', u' That\u2019s an interesting point about miniature as an art form. What is noteworthy is that neither of us is trained in miniature art because we did not study at [NCA\u2019s miniature] department. Do you see a certain influence that miniature as an art form has on Pakistani art? ', u' It\u2019s very relevant here. Its [influence is] instantly recognisable from far away. ', u' I do agree with the idea that miniature is instantly recognisable as a Muslim art form that creates a link between modern-day Pakistani art and Persian culture. I think that\u2019s part of the reason the genre is as successful as it is. But I\u2019ve often wondered why other genres haven\u2019t developed the same way.', u'Colin David was a huge influence on me and I know on you also because we were both in his figure drawing class. I always thought his themes and the way he approached art, althought not miniatures, were very contemporary. ', u' [Yes, his work] was very contemporary. What we probably ended up liking about him was that his work was so smooth and really fun to look at. He did not go for gravitas and that is the kind of painting that attracts me. ', u' [His work] was so well executed, so differently painted and so differently imagined from the works of a lot of other artists who were working around the same time. ', u' Totally. And in terms of genre, the global art market is very tricky [for Pakistani artists who want] to be fun or frivolous or sexy or ironic because there are too many headlines that get in the way. ', u' Do you think any new art forms are coming up?', u' Yes, I think object-making and sculpture are coming up. I think a revival of picture-making [is happening] among young people. [It is resulting in] vivid paintings and figurative art. I am seeing a lot of art by young people which has human bodies or human faces or human stories in it. What really turns me on about that is that it is local. It is kind of self-unconscious [about its acceptability in the] global art market. It is not trying to sell brownness to white people. There should be more of it.', u' I know that a lot of people reading this would know about such artists as Shahzia Sikander, Rashid Rana and Imran Qureshi. How do you view their influence on younger artists?', u' They have all been a huge influence on everyone. But I think the kind of work that you and I are doing, however, traces its lineage to Raja Ravi Varma and Amrita Sher-Gil (both pioneers of modern Indian art). The last person in this lineage is [Indian artist] Bhupen Khakhar who is another imaginative figurative painter. What we are doing, in a sense, has happened before [in the Subcontinent]. You can [get] your artistic legacy from any culture that you like and do with it as you please as long as what you are doing pleases you. ', u' Yes, the idea of being able to appropriate elements from different cultures and use them in your work [has always existed]. Any kind of tension in that is usually robust in artists of post-colonial cultures. I was, for example, always questioned by American students who I went to college with about my interest in Western art. A lot of them would ask, \u201cWhy do you want to study the Renaissance or Baroque period? What is it about the Western artists that appeals to you?\u201d [But Western art] is not outside my own art history. A lot of Western art is as much a part of my art history as miniature is or Hindu sculpture is. Different national movements notwithstanding, I think this [eclecticism] remains true [all over the world]. ', u'We both live in New York as well as in Lahore and we have studios in both cities. What are the pressures that you feel because of being in this situation? ', u' In New York, [I have heard] clich\xe9s that people can easily give in to [about me] \u2014 like #brown, #Muslim. It has very much to do with our [Pakistani] nationality and our national interests. ', u' [These perceptions] are not limited to the American art market but also to the rise of the global art markets, which affects us all. The other thing about the American art scene is that it has gone from being what used to be a global barometer of an international art scene to becoming something extremely particular to America. ', u'But I agree with you, in that whenever foreigners look at Pakistan through different art forms, be it movies, literature or art, a lot of people also expect Pakistani artists to talk about extremism and politics. Do you think that [the artists] have a responsibility to do that? ', u' It\u2019s a clich\xe9d statement that the artist should respond to their times and it\u2019s sort of true. When people are honestly producing their work, they do end up responding to their time in one way or the other.', u'\t\t\t\n', u'There is also a lot of pressure of expectations [exerted] by the consumers of art that is coming out of [our] region \u2014 as to what art should be about, what it should look like. Should it be a byline to the headlines? Should it resist the headlines? Or should it oppose the headlines? Many artists may have succumbed to this pressure. I do not think if it is necessarily a horrible thing. ', u' What do you think about self-censorship? What do you think of not going into a certain place in art or in writing, particularly in Pakistan, out of say, fear of controversy or retribution?', u' A certain amount of self-censorship has always been there in the Subcontinent and it has bred a lot of creativity because you have to be very clever and subtle to say things that you do not want to say overtly and explicitly. ', u' The idea that you have to work around the rules may have always existed. What I am asking about is not whether the artists of today are trying to invent new ways of going around the laws but whether they are avoiding engaging with certain topics at all because engaging with those topics would have a certain amount of repercussions. ', u' I don\u2019t know about other people but I can speak for myself and I don\u2019t really censor myself. Not that I have something outrageously unlawful to say. I like to tell some nuanced stories. I think what you are talking about is art that wants to throw a stone at the window, like protest art. ', u' Not necessarily protest art, but I am more interested in the idea of art not even subtly going to places that ordinarily it may. For me, the most obvious topic is religion. When I talk to different artists about religion, some of them talk in tangential ways. When I ask them why they would not like to talk about it more overtly, it seems they are too afraid to. That\u2019s the kind of self-censorship that I am talking about \u2014 that as an artist you would not want to venture into certain subjects, not necessarily because you don\u2019t want to go there but because you feel that you cannot. ', u' Ideas such as religion and progress are highly loaded things to talk about, especially here. A lot of topics related to these subjects are against the law in this country. I actually think it is more challenging to work within the tradition and work within the laws \u2014 to try to reinvent the cultural forms, the mix of Islamic and Hindu traditions that have come down to us.', u' [Self-censorship] happens in different ways in the West but there it is more about form than content.', u' Completely. It also happens with reference to certain issues as well \u2014 for instance, Black Lives Matter. ', u' We have been talking about the content of art but actually all art is also objects made for sale. Do you ever get used to the idea of people buying your work? ', u' No, never. You?', u' Yeah, same. It feels like a giant conceit.  ', u' It\u2019s also the realisation that [the selling of your work will put an end] to the pleasure that you were having when you were making it. [Your work will have to get out of the] control that you exercised on it when it used to be in your studio. ', u' Does it matter to you where your work ends up? I have had people argue with me about the square-footage or the inches of a painting and that is possibly the only thing that has put me off selling.', u' The commodification of art is not the end of the world. Here is a piece of advice that I would like to give to all other artists working now \u2014 be professional. Once a piece of art leaves your studio, it does not matter if it ends up in an independent curator\u2019s hands or if it ends up on someone\u2019s wall. It also does not matter how they treat it, what they say about it or how they feel about it. A lot of the time, all that is completely unrelated to your art. ', u' True. It also depends on where they are saying it. I mean, when we began working, when we both went to America, Shahzia Sikander was a huge presence in the American art scene. She was the only Pakistani whose work was taught to us in Art History 101 but, over the years, there has been an increase in the number of Pakistani artists whose practices are based here in Pakistan but who have become globally famous. When we were growing up, there was no real template as to what to do as an artist who wanted to work in America or here or in both places. Now, I feel that a lot of students are very comfortable working in Pakistan while knowing that they have an opportunity to have a global career. ', u'Do you think that art students in Pakistan are aware of the global art market? ', u' Not really. A lot of work needs to be done on those students [to make them aware of the global art market]. ', u'\t\t\t\n', u' What other advice would you give to someone who wants to be an artist working in Pakistan? ', u' You should only do art if you are prepared to be very poor for a very long time. But if working in your studio fulfils you, then keep working despite poverty. What about you?', u' Whenever I\u2019m asked this, I always think of solitude. Being an artist is a very solitary existence. A hideous office filled with fluorescent lighting in the most awful building is still filled with people and there is a very different energy that comes about when you have people [around]. But if you are any kind of artist, you will eventually have to be alone for a long period of time. If you are okay with being alone for eight to 10 hours a day, and you are prepared to devote that amount of your life to your art practice, then you should go for it. ', u' I would choose a studio over an office any day. ', u' I\u2019ve loved working in offices sometimes. ', u' I just can\u2019t. I love taking my colours and coffee to the studio and being alone there. ', u' Did you ever think that you could be anything other than an artist? ', u' No. I tried for a year but it did not work. Do you remember that?', u' I do! For me, I came to art after weighing other options. ', u' Do you still love it?', u' Everyday. ', u' Same.'], 'link': 'https://herald.dawn.com/news/1154032/self-censorship-has-always-been-there-in-the-subcontinent-salman-toor', 'heading': u'Self-censorship has always been there in the Subcontinent: Salman Toor'}

Mr Sharif was also informed why the party could not win all the 12 seats in Punjab despite having a fair chance of it in the face of a divided opposition.

He was responsible for making \u2018separate pools\u2019 for seven candidates of the PML-N.

{'date': u' ', 'text': [u'\t\t\t\n', u'Authors of Pakistani origin writing in English are on fire abroad. And in Pakistan, they are igniting a frisson of excitement and minor pyrotechnics among their readership. It is a moment to celebrate. If this reviewer could create awards, say, the ', u' Best Novels Awards 2017, these would go to Osama Siddique, for his superb, succinct yet vast book ', u', and to Sami Shah for ', u'. With these exceptional novels, the two writers have changed the texture and tone of Pakistani English fiction. ', u'Irrefutable evidence that possession, and being possessed, is the current state of Pakistani English literature can be found in ', u', a captivating collection of short stories edited by Mahvesh Murad and Jared Shurin. Included in this collection are spellbinding and riveting stories by contemporary writers of Pakistani origin such as Sami Shah and Usman T Malik. Transformative? Yes.   ', u'Most of the authors getting attention are those who emerged on the international scene and are on their third or fourth novel. Mohsin Hamid with ', u' and Kamila Shamsie with ', u', made it to the longlist for the Man Booker Prize in 2017. Hamid\u2019s ', u', too, was shortlisted for the Booker, in 2007.  ', u'Pakistani novelists located in Pakistan and abroad \u2013 at first mostly women; now increasingly women and men in equal numbers \u2013 have been writing in English for 70 years. Getting noticed and unnoticed in unequal measure and owning this tongue of the Empire, they have been telling stories that chip away at boundaries and categories within ourselves and between \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019, the colonised and the coloniser, the post-Empire and the new empires. ', u'The numbers are increasing exponentially. This alone is exhilarating. Over 100 writers have over 150 novels and many anthologies among them. But they have not necessarily written 150 different and good stories which resonate with an audience beyond a small elite group. And this may be because we cannot exorcise our colonial past or rise beyond our vantage points of birth. ', u'There are shimmering exceptions. These are bookended between Azhar Abidi\u2019s two splendid works \u2013 his 2006 glorious gem ', u' and 2008 book ', u' \u2013 and ', u' and ', u'. In between them, Jamil Ahmad\u2019s quiet, gracefully told and powerful ', u', published in 2011, is one of the finest pieces of English fiction from Pakistan. ', u'In the same category is Faiqa Mansab\u2019s ', u' that literally embraces the \u2018other\u2019. Set in the underbelly of Lahore, it talks about poverty, power and the shimmer of other worlds. It betrays class and social order, as does Feryal Gauhar\u2019s ', u', a fearless literary gem. If these were to be translated into Urdu, they would probably be banned. They are that good. ', u' lays out the most imaginative landscape. It covers the entire breadth and measure of the great possibilities of Pakistani English fiction \u2014 ranging from memoir to fantasy. The novel, spread over six eras and arranged like an accordion, contracts and expands in time. It distills the past and the future to highlight the essence of our civilization, reminding us of who we were and are, imagining what is to come and encompassing epochs, saints, sages, monks, priests, fraudsters, frogs, dragonflies, pilots, princes, paupers and predators. If it is translated into other languages, including Urdu, it will still shine. ', u'The writers I would suggest you read, other than the ones I have already mentioned, are Mohammed Hanif, Saba Imtiaz, H M Naqvi, Rayika Choudri, Shandana Minhas, Soniah Kamal, Omar Shahid Hamid, Bina Shah and Humera Afridi. Why? Because they see and show us how to see by making the page come alive with their words. They enrich our imagination. They draw the reader in as if they are practitioners of origami who turn paper into pieces of art. They make the reader see something in a new way or be disturbed by it long after they have read about it. Their writing is introspective. It is evocative. ', u'In the last year, around 20 new Pakistani novels in English were published. Their storytelling has moved on to geographies beyond our homes, to imagined lives: on an island beyond our shores, beyond Earth, even beyond time into centuries that are yet to come. Read ', u' by Sidra F Sheikh and ', u' by Maha Khan Phillips. ', u'The previous year\u2019s bumper crop also includes ', u' by Shahbano Bilgrami, ', u' by Omar Shahid Hamid, ', u' by Nadeem Aslam and, translated from the Urdu masterpiece, ', u' by Abdullah Hussein. Read them all. ', u'\t\t\t\n', u'Pakistani English fiction\u2019s growth may also be due to a flourishing of journalism as freedom of the press and expression has expanded post-military dictatorships. By writing for newspapers and magazines, writers got a break and an outlet for honing their writing skills. Then the digital and social media revolutions happened and they made writing unstoppable. With dozens of television channels and now a fledgling but promising film industry beginning to blossom, the demand for scriptwriters and copywriters continues to burgeon. ', u'Much is expected from our writers. They are expected to be intellectuals able to map injustices, the logic of war and military occupation and the subversion of truth. They are expected to be well versed in the reality that is the world order. Yet few are. The others could be writing pulp fiction.', u'The historical growth of Pakistani narratives in English is mapped in Muneeza Shamsie\u2019s labour of love, ', u'. Most Pakistani fiction is about Partition, houses and property lost and the civil war in what was once East Pakistan. We also write about feudal families, the martial law years under General Ziaul Haq and the life and times of Benazir Bhutto (while claiming that we are not writing about either of the two). ', u'We write about how British or American we really are. We write as if we are rich people doing rich things without any introspection. We write about those fundamentalists, fanatics and jihadists who are not us. We rarely write novels which open our eyes and hearts to an experience that we haven\u2019t had ourselves. We write what we know: we write of identity and the humiliations thereof, assuaged by fabulous wealth. We write about that time we went to college abroad and were disoriented and unhappy.  ', u'Perhaps writing fiction has been the only way to get around official facts in Pakistan. When history becomes unbearable and the telling of it dangerous, then perhaps it becomes necessary to put it down as memoir and fiction, making it about one\u2019s own family. As if to fly under the radar of censorship\u2019s scrutiny, as if to say: look this is harmless; I am only writing about my dysfunctional family; I am not writing about the state; it is just a family saga.', u'Most writers do not write to shock, shake or change (perhaps the next generation will, or our next novel will). If we ever do so, we will do so between the lines to get past the brutality of dictators who do not take kindly to poets or writers, or to get past the reprisal of the class and society most of us belong to. We write like we are afraid. Fearful. Terrified. Of not being accepted. Or of being punished. Perhaps we are. The kindest thing to say about this kind of writing is perhaps that we write between the lines and in doing so we don\u2019t.', u'\t\t\t\n', u'But scriptwriters, playwrights, poets, novelists and short story writers are holding up a mirror to society and are writing compelling stories. They are writing in Urdu, not in English, though. Someday when their works are translated, the English readership will be better off because of them. These writers are challenging the norms in poetry and in prose, fearlessly taking on tough social issues with considerable humour and rage. Syed Kashif Raza is an example with his poetry and soon to be published novel. Julien Columeau, a Frenchman, with his short stories, ', u', is another example. Many Pakistani writers of English may not be able to read him or others like him because they cannot read or write in Urdu \u2014 or in any other Pakistani language. ', u'That is why they write in English. Urdu, Punjabi or Sindhi poetry they quote or take inspiration from comes to them in English translation from Agha Shahid Ali, Frances W Pritchett, Naomi Lazard, Ralph Russell, Annemarie Schimmel and Victor G Kiernan. That says something. Tragic.', u'Mohammed Hanif is an exception. His is a controlled rage, though packaged sweetly in a laconic, wry, witty, kind, generous and spirited tone. He is scathingly acerbic, accurate and unforgiving and is as good in Urdu as he is in English. Even better perhaps. ', u'Who reads these works of fiction written in English? Who writes them? Who cares about this fiction? Does it matter? This fiction straddles many worlds and is eloquent in all; it is for all \u2014 goes the argument in its favour. This is global storytelling. Not Pakistani per se.', u'The original sin, the story goes, was when the beloved father of the nation, an England-educated gentleman, announced in English that the official language of Pakistan would be Urdu to audiences who could understand or speak neither. You can imagine how squatting listeners withering in the sun in Dhaka that day or listening to him over thousands of radios a thousand miles away in West Pakistan must have scratched their heads and asked each other, \u201cWhat is he on about?\u201d ', u'The great gentleman could be forgiven. A native Gujrati speaker himself and comfortable in the English of his schooling and legal training and practice, he might have thought that his Bengali audience was just as likely to understand him in English as in Urdu, especially since he spoke haltingly in Urdu given that it was not his native tongue. He was more at ease, crisp, precise and eloquent in English than in any other language. ', u'\t\t\t\n', u'As are today\u2019s Pakistani writers in English. And that may be a problem. ', u'Our English writers speak to each other and, for now, to a small readership within the country, though they have a larger market abroad and among the diaspora. Educated in private schools at home and abroad, they write from places far away from Pakistan or from cocooned places within Pakistan where the elite congregate, walled away from the country\u2019s reality. Much like Christiane Amanpour reporting about the American invasion of Afghanistan from the rooftop of Islamabad\u2019s Marriot Hotel. ', u'And their novels tell the same story one way or the other as if processing, re-enacting and litigating the many complexities encapsulated in the moment of Partition and displacement \u2014 or the moment leading to that moment or the moment after that. At this moment, they cannot seem to dissociate their writing from the vantage point of a passenger in flight out of the country. ', u'Compelling, illuminating and transformational writing is an act of betrayal of the world a writer lives in. Pakistan\u2019s English writers by and large have not been betrayers. Their narratives seem to be received from headlines and remain, to a large degree, oriented towards imagining reality and the world through European and American perceptions. Writing in English but not for ourselves remains our colonial challenge and dilemma, something we cannot seem to overcome. ', u'Statistically speaking, Pakistan is the third largest country in the world where English is a major medium of instruction but only the elite write and read in it. What they write reflects that they look for validation and an audience elsewhere. Perhaps that is fine: those who read and write English, after all, are taking up leadership positions at global forums. Another thing to be proud of. But are they changing narratives about Pakistan? ', u'Pakistan\u2019s literacy rates hold it back from marshalling the power of its numbers to influence intellectual thought globally. Its low literacy rate has a lot to do with elite capture of resources. But even with these caveats, Pakistani writers are in possession of the English language and, at the current rate of their progress, will own it. English is as much ours now as anybody else\u2019s, our demons and our angels. ', u'Pakistan is also the third largest military contributor to the United Nations peacekeeping forces around the globe. Our military footprint is also visible in the Middle East. These facts seem to play an important role in why our elite, a class enamoured by power, is writing and reading narratives that support war. How much of Pakistani fiction in English justifies war and jihad porn? How much of it reeks of orientalism? If Europeans had written these novels would we have screamed accusations of orientalism and white male privilege against them? ', u'International recognition of Pakistan\u2019s fiction writers goes hand in hand with war. In the last 17 years \u2013 when wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have been ongoing and spilling over and expanding into our own territory \u2013 Pakistan\u2019s writers in English have achieved global acclaim. War has been marvelous for them.  ', u'Is Pakistani fiction that gets international recognition part of a new world literature that, in turn, feeds a narrative dominant in the current global order? When called out for promoting the dominant narratives of global power or for downright misrepresentations in their fiction, our writers are quick to their own defense, haughtily shrugging off the accusation by glibly pointing out that they write \u2018lies\u2019, after all that is what fiction means. ', u'Problematically, however, renowned fiction writers of Pakistani origin also report news and write commentary, posing as Pakistan\u2019s credible voice for a global audience. They are writers of fiction but are regularly called upon as writers of fact, contributing to a global conversation on all things related to war and terrorism and, thus, adding to public records of the \u2018Pakistani\u2019 view in American and British newspapers. This only strengthens the dominant narrative in favour of an endless war that is now in its 18th year. ', u'Why are their writings on news judged and bound by their places of origin and national identity while their storytelling is considered world literature and judged without boundaries? In a world of fake news, is the fiction produced by Pakistanis fake literature? ', u'Increasingly, a novel\u2019s merit is judged by it being published in either India or London or New York. Pakistani authors gain validity only after agents and editors there nod their approval. And if this happens then it does not matter if the storytelling tends to be the rich kid\u2019s view of the world \u2014 a Harry Potter version of poverty, refugees and migration or a Jane Austen version of everything else. ', u'\u201cPakistani fiction has come of age. New and emerging Pakistani writers are taking big leaps of faith and venturing into new genres such as literary thrillers, science fiction, fantasy and even graphic novels. The literary fiction from Pakistan is at par with fiction from anywhere else in the Subcontinent,\u201d says Kanishka Gupta, a literary agent in India who has signed up many authors from Pakistan. ', u'Many readers in Pakistan may agree with him \u2014 it is wonderful that our writers are winning awards abroad. Often, though, it seems that such praise has been more for the celebrity of the writers than for their writing. People may name a few authors but almost never the books they have written. People may have read articles about certain writers. They may have also perused articles written by novelists of Pakistani origin in such newspapers as the ', u' and ', u'. ', u'Uncharitable opinions also abound and these term Pakistani writing in English as ordinary things told in ordinary ways, as jihad porn, as parroting western headlines.  ', u'\t\t\t\n', u'It may be unfair to expect that Pakistani fiction writers in English write researched histories of their people and their land or other peoples and other lands. But these expectations are owed to the fact that the non-fiction arena in English in Pakistan is dominated by memoirs of retired generals and bureaucrats which readers perhaps treat as fiction.', u'But fiction of any merit is not entertainment. It does not seek to put a positive spin on travesty and atrocity. It is often not a purely feel-good experience unless it is meant for children or as bodice-ripper romance or as pornography. It does not allow us to escape from introspection or exonerate ourselves from the consequences of our actions. It often has the responsibility to tell the truth in powerful ways because most of the written non-fiction, no matter how well written, tells untruths. ', u'But there is a tendency among Pakistani English writers not to do that. Instead, they have a tendency to be the sole spokesperson for Pakistan, speaking to a foreign power in the way it wants to be addressed and, in the process, strangulating and muffling all other voices. The urgency to be the native informant. Why is this so? The answer is complicated. It may boil down to geographical boundaries and political blueprints imposed on us by our colonial masters and the abused nature of our still-colonised society in a country that, to foreign interests, seems nothing more than a potash mine, a petroleum field or a port \u2014 the great plantation and its house slaves yearning not to be free.', u'Colonisation tends to keep on giving long after the colonisers have physically left. Literary careers are made in the nostalgia for it. The writers who are nostalgic about it are labelled as native informants mostly by those who are bitter about their success. These native informants, the accusations go, tend to continue having the out-of-body experience of never being able to be themselves. They can only see themselves through eyes that are not their own \u2014 always imagining and narrating reality in a way that might be pleasing to the colonial abuser. They pick up subjects that are pleasing to the abuser. They create characters that fit the characterisations created by the abuser. They stick to the dominant power\u2019s narrative.  ', u'The novels that get praise abroad, and subsequently in Pakistan, promote narratives written in the tradition of taking cues from elsewhere and seeing Pakistan from a foreigner\u2019s eyes. Even the websites for the authors published abroad do not mention reviews and interviews published in Pakistani magazines or newspapers. The opinions of outsiders matter the most because the blueprints for Pakistan\u2019s narrative and its boundaries were, after all, decided elsewhere. This condition confines our writing in English to a constant seeking of approval from the colonial makers of our polity and society. ', u'English remains the language of masters. We are likely to command our dogs in English. To us, it is the language of consequence, of unquestionable authority, and it informs our relationship with those who are below us and those who are above us. We have servants and we have masters and we use two voices to converse with them: the one with which we snarl and bark at servants and the other full of deferential tonal genuflections with which we supplicate to masters. Those who do not have these two choices have their own voices to listen to but we call them \u2018the voiceless\u2019.  ', u'Pakistan\u2019s literature is far more than the written word. It is also the spoken word that we hear from storytellers. Rapt listeners hear such stories in villages, at chai khanas and in the laps of mothers. These are stories of ordinary things told in extraordinary ways. They talk of fantastic things in even more phantasmagorical but relatable ways. But those of us who write in English seem to have been rendered tone deaf by the din of giving and taking orders and the roar of the jet engine revving up for our flight to success \u2014 one that we are so anxious about missing. ', u'The fiction produced by such writers does not reflect the lives and experiences of \u2018the voiceless\u2019 \u2014 their joys and foibles, their sorrows and mysteries, their triumphs and injustices. This may be because most of its creators rarely rub shoulders with those socially different from themselves and remain cloistered in the enclaves of the well-to-do. Most of the writers are not really rooted in Pakistan. They have stakes in other places outside of Pakistan. ', u'Examples of the world\u2019s great writers who did not live in their own homelands is often given as a justification for this, but those writers were often exiled and they wrote in their native languages to be understood first and foremost by their own people. Their writing was so good that it was worth translating. ', u'The world\u2019s great novels read in English were not all written in English. They include translations into English from Russian, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Arabic, Serbo-Croatian, Chinese and Japanese. Perhaps Pakistan\u2019s great English novel will be one that is translated from a local language \u2014 a few have already been translated. ', u'Urdu literature, both old and new, shines in its own skin. When it is translated into English, it continues to sparkle because it is good. Would Pakistani English novels written so far hold up that way if translated into Urdu? Think about it. Some might. Most would not. ', u'Two major Urdu novels have been translated into English recently \u2014 Abdullah Hussain\u2019s ', u' (as ', u') and Intizar Husain\u2019s Basti. An English translation of short stories by master narrator Ghulam Abbas has also appeared under the title of The Women\u2019s Quarter: Selected Short Stories. These works were written decades ago. Urdu readers read them when they were first published. English readers have only found them now. Translations of Urdu poetry by Fahmida Riaz and Kishwar Naheed, similarly, are substantively changing the tone and narrative of Pakistani English literature, vastly improving its quality. ', u'\t\t\t\n', u'Such translations are catching on. Ali Madeeh Hashmi recently translated Ali Akbar Natiq\u2019s short stories into English in a volume titled ', u' Urdu to English translations have also been done by Zahra Sabri, Frances W Pritchett, Musharraf Ali Farooqi, Bilal Tanweer and Aamer Hussein.', u'T', u' by Mumtaz Shahnawaz was Pakistan\u2019s first English novel. Its writer died in 1948 before it was published. It deals with Partition\u2019s trauma through the experience of one family. Progressive writer Ahmed Ali wrote ', u' in 1940 while he was still living in that city. He became a reluctant Pakistani after Partition as he continued to pine for his home town of Delhi during his forced migration to Karachi. Zulfikar Ghose\u2019s ', u' was published in 1967. Bapsi Sidhwa self-published her novel, ', u', in the 1980s. She followed it with ', u' that came out in 1988 and was republished as ', u'. It has also been turned into an award-winning film, ', u', in India. She went on to write many more novels. ', u'Author and activist Tariq Ali was perhaps the first Pakistani writer to achieve international renown with his controversial book ', u' which he wrote after the 1971 civil war. It was banned in Pakistan at the time. But it was not a novel. His novels came later and included a quintet that started with ', u' ', u'In 1989, Sara Suleri Goodyear arrived on the literary scene with her novel ', u' and Rukhsana Ahmad published her novel ', u' in 1996. My first novel ', u' was published by Oxford University Press (OUP), Karachi, in 1998. It was the first novel that OUP published. I went on to write four more. ', u'I would like to consider Hanif Kureishi as being linked to Pakistan (even though he does not identify himself as a Pakistani). Many of his short stories and novels are, indeed, about Britons of Pakistani origin. Aamer Hussein, also based in the United Kingdom, has written several works of fiction including ', u'. Nadeem Aslam, another Pakistan-born writer who discovered his creativity while living in the United Kingdom, has written many novels such as ', u', ', u' and ', u' His sorrowful ', u', published in 2004, stands out among his oeuvre. ', u'Back home in Pakistan, works of English fiction have been appearing thick and fast in recent years. Bina Shah was one of the earliest writers to come on the scene in the new millennium. Her promising first novel, ', u', came out in 2001. It was followed by three more \u2014 ', u' and, more recently, ', u' ', u'Uzma Aslam Khan\u2019s sensitive and carefully wrought novel ', u' was also published in 2001. She has written a few others since. These include Trespassing, ', u' and ', u'. These are all worthy of more attention than a mere mention, as are Sorraya Khan\u2019s Noor (published in 2003), ', u' and ', u' ', u'\t\t\t\n', u'Lara Zuberi\u2019s ', u' Sana Munir\u2019s ', u' and Sehba Sarwar\u2019s ', u' (published in 2004) are all worth more than a reference. Also published during the 2000s were Qaisra Sharaz\u2019s ', u' and ', u', Syeda Hina Babar Ali\u2019s ', u' and Javed Amir\u2019s ', u' ', u'Shandana Minhas\u2019s smart and funny novel, ', u', came out in 2007. Almost a decade later she published another, ', u'. The other writer to follow a similar time pattern is Shahbano Bilgrami. Her first novel, ', u', was published in 2007 and her second, ', u' came out last year. ', u'By 2010, Pakistani fiction in English had made its mark to such an extent that Granta magazine published a Pakistan issue that year. It included, among many other pieces of writing, the work of such authors as Sarfraz Manzoor and Fatima Bhutto.', u'Daniyal Mueenuddin\u2019s precisely crafted collection of short stories, ', u' ', u', came out the same year. It is a memorable book of interconnected stories which appear to be based on his family life. H M Naqvi, a gifted wordsmith, also debuted in 2009 with his novel ', u' His second novel, ', u', is set in Karachi. Its excerpts promise a brilliant work by an author who has spent a long time researching his material. Bilal Tanweer\u2019s 2013 novel ', u' combines both the elements mentioned above \u2014 it is about Karachi and it is a stringing together of short stories in the format of a novel. ', u'The speed with which new works of fiction are coming out has only increased in the 2010s. Omar Shahid Hamid has published three novels in five years. His works belong to a new genre of writing in Pakistan. They cover crime, police, security and intelligence. His first novel, ', u' that came out in 2013, took me by surprise. Then he wrote The Spinner\u2019s Tale and ', u' both covering the same ground the first one had. Khalid Muhammed\u2019s ', u' and Akbar Agha\u2019s ', u' also fall in the same genre.  ', u'Saba Imtiaz\u2019s 2014 novel ', u' an intelligent, light page-turner, offers a funny take on the life of a young journalist in a crime-infested, terrorism-plagued metropolis. Anis Shivani\u2019s novel about the same city, ', u', came out in 2015.  ', u'Many other notable works of fiction came out much earlier. Nafisa Haji wrote her first novel, ', u' ', u' in 2011 (and has written another, ', u', since then). Shehryar Fazli\u2019s ', u' was published the same year. It is about an impending civil war in East Pakistan and is narrated through a family\u2019s property dispute, set amid a haze of opium and sex. Aquila Ismail\u2019s heartbreaking and beautifully written ', u' provides a different perspective on the victims of the same war. Shazaf Fatima Haider\u2019s enjoyable debut novel, ', u', came out in 2012 and is a comedy-romance about an arranged marriage. ', u'Of late, three writers have come from the same family. Moni Mohsin, who has two books, ', u' and ', u', to her credit, has been followed by her nephew Ali Sethi with his novel ', u' His sister, Mira Sethi, is also expected to publish her collection of short stories soon. ', u'There have been several anthologies of Pakistani writers too. The one that I found the most exciting, ', u' came out in 2010. Edited by Faiza Sultan Khan and published by Ayesha Raja, it included new writings by Mehreen Ajaz, Ahmad Rafay Alam, Attiq Uddin Ahmed, Sarwat Yasmeen Azeem, Sadaf Halai, Michelle Farooqi, Danish Islam, Madiha Sattar, Aziz A Sheikh and Mohammed Hanif (who translated from Urdu the excerpt of a digest story, ', u'). Another collection of short stories, ', u', that came out recently, includes short stories by Imran Yusuf, Moeen Faruqi and Aziza Ahmad among others.', u'I edited and curated two anthologies, ', u' and ', u'. These contained writings by 180 mostly first-time writers. The Festival, another book that I curated, includes the work of 40 writers of Pakistani origin. It carries translations of the Urdu poetry of Kishwar Naheed and Fahmida Riaz and Sindhi poetry of Hassan Dars (translated into English by New York-based poet Hasan Mujtaba and Mohammed Hanif) as well as writings by Tahira Naqvi, Phiroozeh Romer, Umbreen Butt, Ayesha Salman, Ishaat Habibullah and many more. ', u'\t\t\t\n', u'Muneeza Shamsie, too, has edited two anthologies: ', u' and ', u'. Fawzia Afzal Khan\u2019s anthology ', u' and Indian writer Rahkshanda Jalil\u2019s collection ', u' also feature a large number of Pakistani writers. Bapsi Sidhwa and Asif Farrukhi have compiled and edited collections of English writing respectively about Lahore and Karachi. ', u'Women writers outnumber men in Pakistani English fiction. Yet, bewilderingly, their work is often referred to in dismissive terms \u2013 often by women reviewers \u2013 even though most English fiction writers, English language editors and journalists as well as teachers of English are women. Most of these writers are fearlessly feminist and many of them are socialist to the core. They suspect that some sort of patriarchy and clubby elitism is at play against their writing. ', u'New writers are appearing on Pakistan\u2019s English writing scene every year. The more writers there are, the more powerful the stories will be. They will be interrogating the past, the present and the future in more ways than the existing and previous generations of writers have done. They will stem the tide of revisionism that seeks to cast the world in the moulds set by a new colonialism, and in doing so, they will influence the global discourse in meaningful and constructive ways. ', u'These new writers are showing up in newspaper columns, in feature stories on issues of consequence in magazines and newspapers. They are not living in pristine isolation. They are waiting for their buses during rush hour and they change transport three times to commute between their homes and their workplaces. They live and work far from the quiet and solitary world of air-conditioned SUVs and foreign-funded residential enclaves. ', u'They are not buying into the older narratives anymore. Chasing, filing and editing stories in newsrooms, they are the most exciting writers out there. They will effect change. At least that is my hope. Someday soon, amplifying the received truths churned out in war rooms and concretised as fictionalised truths will not hold. These writers will defy conventional wisdom, bust myths and show us realities beyond anything they have been capable of showing so far.', u'I can hear the susurrus of that change already. Soon it will become a swirling, at a dizzying rate, faster than fast. The new generation of writers will challenge, as well as change, the narrative and the perspective \u2014 not only for Pakistan but for the world.  ', u'If I were asked to imagine Pakistani writing a decade on, I would imagine it this way: questioning everything, honest, sizzling, sparkling, saucy and impudent. It will be crazily creative, leading the world in intellectual domain and ending the failure of imagination that engulfs us now in a long dreamless night.'], 'link': 'https://herald.dawn.com/news/1154041/pakistani-english-fictions-search-for-approval-and-appreciation', 'heading': u"Pakistani English fiction's search for approval and recognition"}

', u'Senator retired Gen Abdul Qayyum said that the members of the lower house of parliament as well as the provincial legislatures were free to join a political party within a timeframe of three days after the notification declaring them returned candidates because they had to vote to elect prime minister and chief ministers, respectively. He said it appeared that no timeframe for joining a political party had been set for senators in the law and they could do it anytime. ', u'Later talking to Dawn, Mr Qayyum said Article 51 of the Constitution defined the composition while Article 106 dealt with the composition of the provincial assemblies. He said both Articles described the procedure for election on reserved seats for women through proportionate representation system on the basis of general seats won by political parties and the priority lists submitted by them. He said provisos at the end of both the clauses read \u201cProvided that for the purpose of the sub-clause, the total number of general seats won by a political party shall include the independent returned candidate or candidates who may duly join such political party within three days of the publication in the official gazette of the names of the returned candidates\u201d. ', u'Constitutional provision for Senate is silent on timing for joining a political party', u'He said the Constitution recognised the right of the lawmakers to join a political party after winning as independent candidates, but no timeframe had been set for the purpose. \u201cHow can a right available to the members of the national and provincial assemblies be denied to members of the parliament\u2019s upper house?\u201d he questioned. ', u'A senior official of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), when contacted, endorsed the view saying that the members of the national and provincial assemblies get three days to join a political party as the number of reserved seats is to be determined on the basis of the total general seats won by them. But, he added, this was not the case with senators. ', u'He said though the constitution had left it open for senators to join a political party any time, there was a clear provision in the rules and procedures for the conduct of business in the Senate. ', u'He said Rules 15 (1) of the Senate read: \u201cAn independent member including a member from Fata, elected to the Senate, may exercise his option to join the treasury or, as the case may be, the opposition benches within seven days of making oath before the Senate and shall inform the Secretary in writing, who shall immediately notify the option so exercised by the member\u201d. ', u'Some senators also expressed their concern over delay in giving the right to vote to overseas Pakistanis and the huge gap of 12 million among male and female voters. ', u'Senator Mohsin Aziz of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf moved a motion about non-issuance of CNICs to a large number of women which has resulted in non-registration of their names in the voters\u2019 lists. ', u'Mr Aziz said that the gap had grown in years from 10 million to 12 million. He said according to the population census results, the male and female population was almost equal and thus the gap was alarming. ', u'Senator Sherry Rehman of Pakistan Peoples Party warned that if the issue of huge number of women who could not use their right to franchise was not resolved on a war footing, the country would not be able to overcome the mammoth task of gender mainstreaming. ', u'Winding up the debate, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said that the government gave equal importance to all areas for registration of women, whether it is a backward area of Balochistan or the modern city of Islamabad. ', u'He rejected the claims that the people of Balo\xadchistan, Khyber Pakhtun\xadkhwa and Fata were facing any kind of discrimination as the number of registered women and men in these areas was much higher compared to that of Islamabad. ', u'Federal law minister Mehmood Bashir Virk informed the Senate that in light of Supreme Court order software was being prepared to enable overseas Pakistanis to use their right to franchise. ', u'However, the minister contended that there was need for extreme prudence and consideration with regards to the matter and that instead of getting entangled in a multi-faced issue, other issues, concerning the masses needed to be addressed. ', u'Winding up a debate on a motion, moved by PTI Senator Mohammad Azam Swati, to discuss the steps taken so far by the government to grant the right to franchise to expatriate Pakistanis, he warned that any decision taken in haste could be disastrous.

', u'The ECP has issued notices to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan, Minister of State for Information Marri\xadyum Aurangzeb, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Engineer Amir Muqam, leaders of two factions of the Muttahida Qaumi Move\xadment-Pakistan (MQM-P) Dr Farooq Sattar and Khawaja Izharul Hassan, Pak Sarza\xadmeen Party\u2019s (PSP) Raza Haroon, MNA from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas Shahabuddin and PML-N MPA from Punjab Uzma Bokhari. ', u'ECP summons eight for alleging votes were purchased in March 3 Senate poll; PTI slams move', u'Almost all these parties are pointing fingers at the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), alleging that the party at the behest of Asif Zardari resorted to \u201cworst kind\u201d of horse-trading, especially in Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan assemblies. ', u'But interestingly, the ECP has not summoned anyone from the PPP. ', u'The parties are criticising the PPP for what they call playing \u201ca dirty role\u201d in Balochistan and KP. In Balochistan, the PPP does not have a single MPA, but it now claims that the candidates backed by the party have won in the province. \nSimilarly, questions are being raised over the return of two PPP candidates from the KP assembly where the party has only seven MPAs. ', u'When asked why no one from the PPP had been summoned, ECP spokesman Haroon Shinwari explained that the commission had in the first place summoned those political leaders whose statements appeared in the media in which they had alleged the use of money in the Senate elections. In the next stage, he said, those parties would be summoned against whom allegations were being levelled. ', u'The spokesman explai\xadned that the ECP had taken this action because it wanted the politicians to assist it in identifying those who had ind\xadulged in undemocratic practices during the Senate polls. ', u'Political and legal experts, however, believe that the ECP exercise will bear no fruit as it will be difficult for the accusers to prove their allegations, particularly regarding the purchase of votes. ', u'PTI information secretary Fawad Chaudhry criticised the ECP move and said that it was strange that instead of holding investigations, the commission was asking them to bring the evidence. He said it was a responsibility of the ECP to see how those candidates had managed to win the elections whose parties had no representation in the assemblies. ', u'Mr Chaudhry said the PTI had already conducted an internal inquiry and placed 16 of its MPAs in \u201cgrey list\u201d. He said that now the KP government would ask the provincial anti-corruption department to hold investigation against these MPAs. He said the party would provide the names to investigation agencies, and not to the media. ', u'Earlier, speaking at a news conference, Mr Chaudhry had announced that the PTI would introduce an amendment to the Constitution in parliament to change the mode of Senate elections in order to make them fair and transparent. ', u'PML-N Quaid Nawaz Sharif had blamed the political parties that secured more seats than their proportional representation in the provincial assemblies for \u201crigging the Senate elections\u201d and demanded an investigation to ascertain if the change of loyalty was based on change of mind, financial gain or some other factors. ', u'Despite the fact that the PML-N emerged as the largest party in the election for the upper house of parliament, the former prime minister said the game of trading of votes must come to an end. ', u'The same demand was made by PTI chief Imran Khan at a news conference in Karachi on Monday. He said that according to his information votes were purchased for up to Rs40 million in the Senate elections. He admitted that his party lawmakers had also \u201csold themselves\u201d. ', u'Mr Khan said the PTI had been asking the ECP to replace the old secret ballot system with open voting to check corrupt practices, but the ECP did not accept the demand. He had asked Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar take notice of the horse-trading, explaining that those who had bribed the lawmakers were known but the legislators who had allegedly taken bribe to switch loyalty were not traceable. ', u'The MQM-Pakistan, which suffered a major setback in the election, announced that it would challenge the Senate polls in the ECP and courts, accusing the PPP and PSP of \u201charassing\u201d the party lawmakers and \u201cselling\u201d the mandate of Karachi. ', u'Addressing a press conference, Dr Farooq Sattar, who heads the PIB group of the MQM-P, had said the Senate elections lost credibility as they were not held impartially and transparently. ', u'\u201cOur investigation shows that our more than 15 MPAs were harassed to change their loyalty. We are also doing our homework to take action against those MPAs who cast their votes against the policy and we have already sent notices to six of them,\u201d Dr Sattar said. ', u'Similarly, raising questions over the victory of PTI\u2019s Chaudhry Sarwar from Punjab, Marriyum Aurangzeb and Amir Muqam had accused the PTI of resorting to horse-trading and using money to purchase votes. They said Imran Khan had been making a hue and cry over rigging in the elections but was silent on the victory of his own man in Punjab. ', u'The PML-N leaders had asked Mr Khan to explain how Chaudhry Sarwar managed to get 44 votes in the Punjab Assembly where his party only had 30 MPAs.'], 'link': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1393707/politicians-asked-to-prove-charges-of-horse-trading', 'heading': u'Politicians asked to prove charges of horse-trading'}

{'date': u' March 07, 2018', 'text': [u'ISLAMABAD: Former senator and Pakistan Mus\xadlim League-Nawaz loyalist Nehal Hashmi, who spent one month in pri\xadson for his outburst against the judiciary, has again landed himself in trouble for his fresh invective soon after his release from Rawalpindi\u2019s Adiala jail.', u'A three-judge Supreme Court bench, headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, took exception to his fresh outburst on Tuesday and ordered registration of a fresh FIR against him. The bench also ordered showing of the video clip in which Hashmi garlanded with roses was seen uttering words against the judges of the superior judiciary. ', u'Why not his sentence be enhanced, the chief justice wondered and then ordered the former PML-N senator to appear in person on Wednesday to explain his position.', u'It all started when an intra-court appeal against Hashmi\u2019s conviction was taken up by the apex court. In his plea, he contended that he was punished though he had offered an unconditional apology. The court should have shown lenient behaviour since the record, according to him, did not show any contempt of court.', u'When the case was taken up, neither Hashmi nor his legal counsel Kamran Murtaza was present in the courtroom. At this, the chief justice asked the court staff to ask his counsel to appear before the bench.', u'After some time, the counsel appeared and objected to the presence of the chief justice as a member of the bench citing that the contempt case was initiated on a suo motu initiated by him. Moreover, he argued, the intra court appeal should be heard not by a three-judge bench rather by a larger bench. He added that Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan was part of the bench which had framed charges against his client.', u'But the chief justice observed that he would not abstain and ordered that the relevant footage be showed in the courtroom through a multimedia facility. When the uncharitable and objectionable remarks were uttered by the former senator in the video clip, the chief justice ordered to repeat the footage again and again.', u'Why a fresh FIR should not be registered against Mr Hashmi, wondered the chief justice. The counsel replied that the entire situation was embarrassing for him, citing that he had no idea about the recent utterances by his client. He also explained that he did not take up the case on a monetary consideration.', u'\u201cI have always respected the courts and the judiciary,\u201d he said. On this, the chief justice said that this was a test case for the counsel who is Pakistan Bar Council vice chairman.', u'The counsel requested the court not to repeat the abusive words as he said his head bowed in shame when he heard those words. The court had mentioned the same while dictating the orders but then deleted the remarks from the order. The court also ordered registration of an FIR against the former senator over his words.', u'The Supreme Court had sent the firebrand Hashmi to Adiyala Prison last month on a contempt charge, eight months after his outburst on May 28, 2017 in which he appeared to have threatened the Joint Investigation Team members appointed by the apex court and the judiciary for probing into the Panama Papers allegations against former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his family members.', u'In its Feb 1 verdict, the court sentenced the former senator for one month with a fine of Rs50,000 with a simple imprisonment for another 15 days in case failed to pay the fine.', u'Meanwhile, a different bench headed by Justice Ejaz Afzal Khan adjourned the contempt of court proceedings against State Minister for Interior Mohammad Mohammad Tallal Chaudhry for his speeches which the court believed were contemptuous.', u'The minister requested the court for the provision of a CD to him as he said the transcript provided to him earlier had room for mistake as apprehensions of tampering with the material could not be ruled out in a political situation.', u'Justice Khan observed that he knew what he had stated but ordered the prosecution to provide the minister a copy of the CD containing his speeches.', u'Another bench, headed by Justice Sheikh Azmat Saeed, adjourned the case of Federal Minister for Privatisation Daniyal Aziz, also facing similar charges, till March 13.', u'In a related development, MNA Aaisha Gulalai submitted an application with the Margalla police seeking registration of a case against former senator Hashmi for levelling \u201cfalse allegations\u201d against National Accountability Bureau (NAB) thus damaging its reputation, adds Munawer Azeem.', u'Mr Hashmi had reportedly called NAB \u201cthe most corrupt institution of the country and that half of the looted wealth of the country could be recovered if houses of NAB officials are raided.\u201d', u'A police official, when contacted, confirmed receiving the complaint from Ms Gulalai and said they would send it to the prosecution department for legal opinion.

{'date': u'March 07, 2018', 'text': [u'ISLAMABAD: Days before his retirement, Senate Chairman Mian Raza Rabbani on Tuesday expressed concern over the growing judicial meddling in legislative processes and issuance of a contempt notice to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly speaker by the Peshawar High Court. ', u'Speaking in the house, Mr Rabbani said he wanted to relinquish the charge without causing any further rancour between institutions and departments working through or under the Constitution. He also referred to his recent meeting with Chief Justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar and the visit of Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa to the Parliament House to attend a meeting of the Senate\u2019s Committee of the Whole. ', u'The Senate chairman said that events of the last few days had compelled his conscience to draw the attention of the chief justice, in a spirit of understanding, to a detailed judgement in the matter of Zulfiqar Ahmed Bhutta vs Federation of Pakistan in which the Supreme Court had shown constraint in going beyond the veil of \u2018internal proceedings\u2019 of parliament in terms of Article 69 of the Constitution. ', u'Babar warns against \u2018judicialisation of politics and politicisation of the judiciary\u2019; PPP distances itself from remarks', u'Referring to the judgement, he said: \u201cIt appears that the Bill was voted in the Senate of Pakistan on 22.09.2017. We have been informed that various amendments to the said Bill were proposed by some political parties, including the retention of the afore-noted proviso to Section 5 of the Order, 2002. It may also be noted that except for the proviso, Section 5 of the Order, 2002 was retained in its original form in the proposed Bill. ', u'\u201cHowever, it appears that most of the amendments suggested by various parties were not incorporated. The petitioners have vehemently argued that proceedings before the Senate of Pakistan were fundamentally questionable and flawed. \nHowever, we do not wish to enter into this controversy in due deference to the provisions of Article 69 of the Constitution especially so where no specific grounds have been urged that may justify probe and scrutiny of the process by which the Bill was passed in the Senate. ', u'\u201cWe have gone through the record of debates on the Bill and find that no purposeful debates on the Bill took place in the Senate. Nevertheless, we would not like to delve deeper in the said aspect of the issue.\u201d ', u'Mr Rabbani was of the opinion that such restraint as mentioned in the judgement authored by the chief justice himself needed to be exhibited by high courts, lower courts and judicial and quasi-judicial tribunals functioning under the Constitution or any other law for the time being in force as the judiciary and parliament were not at the cross purpose and the aim of both was to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. ', u'\u201cIt is unfortunate that a contempt notice should be issued to the speaker of an assembly. Similarly, information sought by the Islamabad High Court also infringes upon the well-established concept of \u2018internal proceedings\u2019 of parliament. I would have met the Chief Justice of Pakistan to iron out these intra-institutional and intra-jurisdictional issues, but unfortunately the constraint of time does not permit me. ', u'\u201cNevertheless, the office of the Chairman Senate is an office in perpetuity and that office would like an amicable settlement of these jurisdictional issues in the light of institutional respect and the mandate laid down for each organ of the state under the concept of tracheotomy of powers in the Constitution, 1973. I am confident that my successor will carry this torch even if it means of calling on the Chief Justice of Pakistan again,\u201d he observed. ', u'Unlike Mr Rabbani\u2019s softly worded remarks and talk of the spirit of understanding, Farhatullah Babar, a Pakistan Peoples Party Senator known for candidly speaking on issues on which others opt to be diplomatic and extra-cautious, criticised the judiciary. ', u'In his speech, Senator Babar warned against \u201cjudicialisation of politics and politicisation of the judiciary\u201d, \u201cstate within the state\u201d and the utter helplessness of parliament to arrest the downslide. ', u'He said he could not applaud the chief justice swearing that he had no political agenda or the judges quoting from poetry instead of the Constitution and the law. \u201cWhen my village elder Baba Rehamte tells me that the Constitution is supreme I accept it. But when he goes on to also tell me that the Constitution is what he says and not what is written in it then I am appalled,\u201d he remarked. ', u'Mr Babar said that when dignity of courts was upheld by brandishing the contempt law rather than by the force of arguments it was time to ponder. \u201cIt will be a disaster if the election year is allowed to become the year of referendum on the judiciary.\u201d ', u'He said he was also pained to see two states \u2014 one de facto and the other de jure \u2014 often working at cross purposes. The de facto called the shots but refused to submit to accountability, he said, lamenting the failure of parliament to bring legislation for accountability of all, including judges and generals. ', u'The PPP senator said he was distressed that all political parties, including his own, backtracked on the demand for accountability of all with no room for sacred cows. \u201cWe must resolve this contradiction of a state within the state if Pakistan is not to be devoured by it.\u201d ', u'He also warned against attempts to roll back the 18th Constitution Amendment and provincial autonomy. ', u'He said he would soon be a stranger to the house and unable to speak here. \u201cBut nobody will find it easy to stifle my voice and fight for the cause will not be abandoned,\u201d he declared. ', u'The house will meet on Wednesday (today) at 3.30pm. ', u'Meanwhile, former prime minister and central leader of the PPP Raja Pervez Ashraf termed the statement of Farhatullah Babar in the Senate his personal views and opinion. ', u'In a statement, Mr Ashraf said that whatever Senator Babar had stated in his speech in the house did not reflect the position and policy of the PPP and, therefore, it should be taken as his own views which had nothing to do with the party.

Combatants leave their homes knowing they have to die, but civilians are only looking for ways to survive amid bloodshed and strife.

But on Monday, her government told the court that the major was not an accused in the case, even though his name appeared in bold letters in the first information report (FIR) seen by many on social media.

The demand for its withdrawal also seems to be withdrawing from the conscience of mainstream political leaders. ', u'In response to the state government\u2019s move, the court halted the investigations, saying that since the major is an army officer, he cannot be treated as a criminal. These developments sent a loud and clear message: the army will not be prosecuted for its human rights violations. ', u'In Kashmir, the term justice is rarely used anymore as it sounds hollow. Even the state government changed its position from \u201clogical conclusion\u201d to \u201cthe major wasn\u2019t an accused\u201d.

Since the day the Mufti-led government took charge, it has only worsened prospects of peace. Communal harmony and fundamental rights stand eroded, institutions weakened, nepotism is rife, killings and clampdowns are the norm and the future uncertain.

{'date': u' ', 'text': [u'\t\t\t\n', u'The question of regionalism is as old as the 1940 Lahore resolution where Pakistan was presented as a collection of \u201csovereign\u201d territorial units or regions. The subsequent episodes of the country\u2019s story are well-known, including the 1971 second partition. More than 40 years later, the coming general election offers a great opportunity to assess the resilience, or otherwise, of regional political cultures.', u'Pakistaniyat, or the sentiment of \u201cPakistan-ness\u201d, has made significant progress in the course of time. A major survey published in 2008 (but conducted in 2004-2005), entitled The State of Democracy in South Asia, showed that Pakistanis were proud of Pakistan wherever they lived (the interviewees of rural Sindh were the \u201cleast\u201d proud \u2013 with 69 per cent \u2013 whereas the inhabitants of northern and central Punjab topped the list with 96 per cent).', u'This is a clear reflection of the impact of state\u2019s policies. After all, nations are also shaped by their states, and national political cultures are influenced by the delimitation of institutional arenas. Pakistan being the framework for competition between elite groups, these groups have had to put their regional identities on the back-burner in order to project themselves as national. ', u"This transition has taken place when the groups in question have achieved power. Sindhi nationalism is a case in point: it has declined after Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) emerged as a vehicle for the Sindhis\u2019 upward political mobility. Why should the Sindhis' ask for more autonomy when they could have access to power at the Centre? ", u'The Punjabis had already \u201cPakistanised\u201d themselves according to the same logic: why should they retain a separate regional identity when they could dominate the whole country? In The State of Democracy in South Asia survey, 64 per cent of the Punjabi respondents declared that they felt only or predominantly Pakistani whereas 19 per cent felt only or predominantly Punjabi. Their role in the army partly explains this commitment to nationalism.', u'At the same time, marginalisation does not necessarily lead to regionalism, as is evident from the case of the Mohajirs. In the same survey, Urdu speakers top the list of those who say that they feel \u201conly\u201d Pakistanis at 60 per cent. This identification with the nation does not reflect a sentiment of domination of the state \u2013 that has been replaced by a sentiment of victimisation since the 1970s \u2013 but the feeling that Pakistan is a creation of the Mohajirs (who cannot identify with any other place anyway).', u'Yet, in most cases, the smaller (and the more marginalised) an ethnic group is, the more inclined towards regionalism it is. But each group includes elite groups which have been co-opted by the national establishment (see how the numbers of Pakhtuns has increased in the army since Ayub Khan). Hence, the split verdict that we find in the survey cited above: while 33 per cent of the Pashto-speaking interviewees felt themselves to be \u201conly national\u201d, 22 per cent felt \u201conly regional\u201d.', u'These figures were, respectively, 18 per cent and 17 per cent in the case of the Baloch, 32 per cent and 29 per cent in the case of the Seraikis and 23 per cent and 36 per cent in the case of the Sindhis.', u'The resilience of ethnic identities is consistent with different political cultures. In The State of Democracy in South Asia survey, only 21 per cent of the Punjabis considered that democracy was preferable to any other regime, against 35 per cent of the Sindhis, 32 per cent of the Pakhtuns and 29 per cent of the Mohajirs. But as many Punjabis and Baloch \u2013 34 per cent \u2013 thought (for different reasons) that democratic and military regimes made no difference whatsoever.', u' Interestingly, democracy did not mean the same thing for every ethnic group. For the Baloch it meant primarily \u201cpeace and security\u201d, for the Sindhis, \u201cjustice and welfare\u201d, and for the Mohajirs \u201cfreedom\u201d. But for none of these groups (except 3 per cent of the Sindhis) it meant \u201celection\u201d. This is exactly the conclusion one draws from the evolution of voter turnout in recent years. In spite of a positive trend in 2008 (in tune with 2002 figures), it has remained 10 percentage points below what it was in 1977.', u'Will the coming election make a significant change in terms of turnout? Does the main challenger of this election, Imran Khan, have the potential to become a game-changer in this respect at least? Although, relying upon a smaller sample than the aforementioned 2008 survey, the pre-election survey conducted by the Herald in March 2013 indicates that, even if it will not deliver the \u201ctsunami of change\u201d that it promised, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) has already started upsetting Pakistani politics as we knew it. The voting intentions of the respondents suggest that PTI is currently the only party \u2013 besides PPP\u2013 which finds significant support across the ethnic spectrum. ', u'Is PTI all set to become Pakistan\u2019s next truly multi-ethnic party? Yes and No. On the one hand, like PPP (but to a lesser extent), PTI has its core constituency in one particular ethnic group, namely, the Pakhtuns (with 31.40 per cent of the registered Pakhtun voters interviewed for the Herald survey declaring their intention to vote for PTI). ', u'On the other hand, though, the PTI also seems to have made a dent into the Punjabi electorate (30.80 per cent of voting intentions), among the Seraikis (23.49 per cent of voting intentions) and to a lesser extent among the Baloch (11 per cent of voting intentions). Even the Mohajirs \u2013 the paradigmatic example of ethnic voters in Pakistan \u2013 seem to have succumbed to Khan\u2019s charm (16.67 per cent of voting intentions), although the limited number of registered Urdu-speaking voters interviewed for this survey makes any generalisation hazardous. ', u'Only the Sindhis seem to have remained unaffected by the Khan factor (nine per cent of voting intentions), with more than half of the Sindhi respondents remaining loyal to PPP. And if we exclude the limited sample of Hindko-speaking registered voters, PTI is the only major party which does not register more than 40 per cent voting intentions in any ethnic group, a characteristic that makes it less \u201cethnic\u201d than PPP. ', u'Could it then be that ethnicity is becoming increasingly irrelevant in Pakistani electoral politics? Once again, the answer should be nuanced. First of all, the Herald survey suggests that all political parties retain a core ethnic constituency, while two parties \u2013 PPP and Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) \u2013 register 50 per cent of voting intentions or more in one specific ethnic group.', u'Secondly, as suggested above, ethnicity seems to remain an important ingredient in shaping political cultures in Pakistan, although this is more obvious for meta-political issues (attitudes towards the institutional set-up of the state of Pakistan at large and the distribution of power within it) than for socio-economic issues. (Pakistani voters across the ethnic spectrum seem to be primarily concerned with the same issues: poverty, corruption and the power crisis). ', u'Thirdly, ethnicity is far from being the only variable shaping the vote of Pakistanis. The Herald survey provides interesting insights in this regard, by suggesting that the vote for certain parties is over-determined by age. Thus, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) would be the \u201coldest\u201d political party in Pakistan, with 46.2 per cent of the registered respondents aged 70 and above declaring their intention to vote for it.', u'However, the influence of the age variable seems to be less significant at the other side of the generational spectrum and no political party (even PTI, which is surprising) registers more than 28 per cent of voting intentions among the 1835 age group (although, on the whole, PTI\u2019s vote share seems inversely correlated to the age of its voters).', u'Ethnicity seems to remain an important ingredient in shaping political\ncultures in Pakistan, although this is more obvious for meta-political\nissues (attitudes towards the institutional set-up of the state of\nPakistan at large and the distribution of power within it) than for\nsocio-economic issues.', u'The urban/rural divide, unsurprisingly, also continues to make its influence felt and the Herald survey suggests that while some parties have a significantly more rural base (PPP, PMLN, Awami National Party), others remain predominantly urban-based (MQM and to a lesser extent PTI). ', u'Class positions remain equally significant. PPP registers the highest share of voting intentions among the poorest voters (with Rs 3600 to Rs 10,000 monthly family income), followed by PMLN. This gap decreases among the lower-middle class and middle-class voters, although PPP still registers the largest share of voting intentions among the Rs 15,001-Rs 30,000 income groups. ', u'MQM, for its part, lives up to its reputation as a lower middle-class/middle-class party, with 43 per cent of its voting intentions coming from respondents with a monthly income between Rs 15,000 and Rs 45,000.', u'However, this phenomenon probably has less to do with the ideology of MQM than with the sociology of the electorate of ethnic/nationalist parties \u2014 the same trend can be observed for Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNPM), for instance. This is less true for ANP, though, which seems to have a stronger support base among poor Pakhtuns. PTI, for its part, could be a major challenge for PMLN as far as the middle/upper class vote is concerned. While PMLN had the highest share of voters from the middle and upper class in 2008, PTI registers the highest share of voting intentions among all the Rs 30,000+ income groups.', u'The level of education seems to play a more complex role. It does affect some parties \u2014 voting intentions for PPP, for instance, are inversely correlated to the level of education, at least until the masters level, while the vast majority of PTI sympathisers seem to come from the educated classes (77 per cent of the respondents declaring their intention to vote for the party have done matriculation or above). ', u'PMLN seems to have a more balanced ratio of highly educated/less educated voters. Interestingly, the level of education seems highly and positively correlated with the vote for nationalist/ethnic parties, such as BNPM and to a lesser extent MQM and ANP (with respectively 82 per cent, 71 per cent and 66 per cent of the respondents declaring their intention to vote for these parties having done matriculation or above).', u'Finally, the influence of gender remains quite limited, although some significant discrepancies seem to prevail in the case of two parties: PPP (which, proportionately at least, would find larger support among women than men) and PTI (so much for Khan\u2019s charm: only 18.3 per cent of registered women voters declared their intention to vote for PTI, against 21.8  per cent of registered men). ', u'It is worth mentioning that the coming elections are taking place in the context of an unprecedented recognition of regionalisms. While the federal dimension of the 1973 Constitution had been repeatedly curtailed under military \u2013 and civilian \u2013 regimes, including during the rule of General (retd) Pervez Musharraf when the local and district governments were promoted at the expense of provincial governments \u2013 the 18th amendment has given the provinces more autonomy than ever before. ', u'Not only have the old bureaucratic names of two provinces been replaced by others \u2014 the Northern Territories becoming Gilgit Baltistan and NWFP becoming Khyber Pakhtunkhwa \u2014 but the 18th amendment has also given new prerogatives to the provinces. In the original version of the 1973 Constitution, there were two lists, the Federal Legislative List which comprised of 67 domains and the Concurrent List which comprised of 47 subjects about which the Centre could legislate.', u'The latter has been abolished and its contents distributed between the Center and the provinces which have gained a lot of power as a result of this distribution. ', u'Clearly, political centralisation \u2013 an old obsession that had resulted in the 1950s from the fear of India (and its instrumentalisation by the ruling elites) \u2013 is not legitimate any more. In this context, political parties have articulated regionalist agendas during the ongoing political campaign. ', u'PPP, for instance, has promised to create a new Seraiki province if it is brought back to power, claiming that it was prevented from doing so until now due to the opposition of \u201canti-Seraiki forces\u201d. The party seems concerned with being rooted out from south Punjab, probably less for its inability to deliver on its promises to create a Seraiki province than for the failure of the federal government in addressing the concerns of the residents of the districts of south Punjab most affected by the 2010 floods (Dera Ghazi Khan, Rajanpur, Muzafargar). PMLN, for its part, has committed itself to declare the four provincial languages as national languages if voted to power.', u'However, it continues to oppose the creation of a new Seraiki province and its top leadership supports, instead, the restoration of Bahawalpur province, which was abolished with the implementation of the One Unit system in 1955.', u'This project could become a bone of contention within the party, though, as some Punjabi leaders of PMLN remain opposed to any division of Punjab. Among the smaller parties, MQM supports the creation of new provinces in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, claiming that this will bring greater stability to the state of Pakistan.', u'However, its electoral manifesto does not make any mention of this issue and advocates, instead, \u201ca national dialogue and consensus\u201d on the controversial issue of \u201cfull provincial autonomy\u201d in the light of the 18th amendment. The position of PTI on these issues is even more cautious. As he can reasonably expect his party to make a dent into south Punjab, Khan has carefully avoided taking a stand on the issue of new provinces, especially on the restoration of Bahawalpur. At the same time, though, PTI entered into a seat adjustment agreement with the Nawab of Bahawalpur, in order to benefit from the vote bank of this undeterred promoter of the Bahawalpur province.  ', u'By requesting political candidates to refrain from seeking votes \u201con the basis of religion, sect, caste or ethnicity\u201d and threatening violators with a three-year jail term, the Electoral Commission of Pakistan recently confirmed the persisting relevance of ethnic bonds in shaping electoral choices. Yet, while most political parties aim at cashing in on this elusive \u201cethnic vote\u201d, their leadership remains aware that ethnicity is only one factor among others shaping the decisions of the Pakistani electorate.', u'Regrettably, the pre-election survey of the Herald did not factor in the role of another crucial variable in this regard, at least in rural areas: biradari/clan affiliations. But as the experts engaged by the Herald in another survey (see Inexpert language) emphasise, these bonds and the vote banks that they sustain remain determinant come election day. This is particularly true in Punjab, where the fate of the next government will be sealed. ', u'All in all, the next elections could see a resurgence of national political forces to the detriment of regionalist ones (this is the case, in particular, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where PTI could be a serious challenge for ANP). Nevertheless, in some parts of the country, ethnic parties will probably reassert themselves (BNPM in Balochistan) or at least save the day for themselves (MQM in Karachi). ', u'Both in Balochistan and Karachi, this persisting relevance of nationalist/ethnic forces is linked to a political context characterised by escalating armed confrontations. The 2013 elections should, therefore, confirm that, in Pakistan as elsewhere, the political relevance of ethnicity is the by-product of political conflicts and socio-economic struggles, rather than the opposite. In the same logic, even the vote for PTI in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will partake in an ethnic colour, as war-weary Pakhtuns will be tempted to give peace a new chance, Imran-style.'], 'link': 'https://herald.dawn.com/news/1153691/do-pakistanis-vote-on-an-ethnic-basis', 'heading': u'Do Pakistanis vote on an ethnic basis?'}

As a nation, we have repeatedly failed to protect our children and the murder in January of Zainab, a seven-year-old girl who was brutally raped, strangled to death and thrown on a pile of garbage in Kasur was the final nail in the coffin. ', u'The sad part is that 11 other minor girls had to endure the same fate as Zainab before the authorities took notice. The cruel fact is that every day 10 children are sexually assaulted in Pakistan, while there has been a seven per cent increase in the number of reported cases of sexual assault of children in the country since 2015. Now more so than ever, we read terrible news of children being raped or murdered across the country. We have to stop and ask ourselves what needs to be done to make our society a safer place for children.', u'Any discussion on child safety or child abuse awareness prompts resistance from conservative groups of society and due to the \u2018taboo\u2019 attached to these topics, many do not report child sexual abuse because they feel it will bring shame on their families. In 2016, Kashf Foundation co-produced an issue-based TV serial called Udaari that raised awareness about child sexual abuse in order to highlight the issue and shatter the misconceptions around it. ', u'An independent evaluation of the Udaari campaign revealed that an overwhelming majority (95pc) of respondents felt that the serial was based on reality, while 66pc said that it had become easier to talk about child sexual abuse after the serial was aired. ', u'Most victims of child sexual abuse feel unable to confide in adults.', u'The research also revealed that only 23pc of the respondents felt that children would talk to somebody else if they were being subjected to abuse. The question to ask at this point is, why are children hesitant to talk to adults if they fall victim to sexual abuse?', u'I am often shocked by the complete inversion of logic that surrounds this issue, the fact that our society ends up blaming the victim, while the abuser often gets away scot-free. ', u'The research revealed that only 38pc of the respondents felt that victims of child sexual abuse are not responsible for what they are subjected to, while only 40pc expressed the opinion that rather than victimising the survivor it should be the abuser who should be held accountable, which implies that such beliefs are deep-rooted and society requires further education. ', u'However, when asked about the call to action in terms of addressing child sexual abuse, 55pc of the respondents said it was essential to educate children about child sexual abuse while 52pc emphasised the importance of building trust based relationships with their children. ', u'Unless awareness programmes which address many of the points mentioned above are carried out in schools and homes, children will not be protected from heinous criminals. It is also important to engage with children and understand their apprehensions and concerns. Unfortunately, in our social set-up, children tend not to voice their opinions. In any case, their views are never taken into consideration. ', u'In a series of focus groups with children between the ages of 5 and 16 in Kasur, there were some clearly relevant findings that need to be considered when designing child safety programmes. The study revealed that most schoolchildren from low-income communities considered their neighbours to be safe, and there was a sense of blind trust as far as neighbours were concerned. ', u'Many of the children were also confused about personal boundaries and a majority shared that they had been physically beaten by either a parent or a teacher. Therefore a large number of them felt they would not be comfortable sharing anything with adults and were also suffering from a sense of guilt. Furthermore, there was also a difference in perception \u2014 girls were more forthcoming in terms of speaking about their personal safety, while the boys were not open to sharing vulnerabilities, something that would, in their eyes, be a sign of weakness. This is of particular concern, since boys are equally at risk of sexual assault.', u'In the light of such findings, it is important that parents as well as teachers talk to children about self-protection and maintaining a safe distance. ', u'They must be made aware of improper touching and if subjected to such behaviour, they must be educated to immediately confide in their parents. Counselling plays a vital role and the community as a whole needs to start going after the abuser rather than the victim. ', u'Eliminating this evil from society is an effort that requires a strong public and government response.

{'date': u' March 07, 2018', 'text': [u'\t\t\t\n', u'A WEEK ago the BBC\u2019s former Pakistan correspondent Owen Bennett-Jones concluded his intermittently fascinating podcast ', u', relating to the events that led up to the murder of Benazir Bhutto 10 years ago last December, with the opinion that the primary motivation was probably grounded in the so-called deep state\u2019s suspicion that, if returned to office, she might compromise the nation\u2019s nuclear status.', u'That\u2019s certainly a possibility. But it\u2019s also just one more conjecture in an incredibly sordid saga. Benazir and the PPP had, after all, seldom been reticent about highlighting her dad\u2019s status as the father of Pakistan\u2019s nuclear bomb. We will eat grass if necessary, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had declared after India\u2019s 1974 nuclear test, but we will obtain a nuclear bomb. A.Q. Khan was the key instrument in fulfilling this ambition.', u'By 2007, A.Q. Khan had been officially outed as a serial nuclear proliferator. But foreign powers were not permitted to question him. Benazir, during her sojourn in the United States months before her projected return to Pakistan after eight years in exile, deviated marginally from that mantra by suggesting that the International Atomic Energy Agency should be allowed access to Khan.', u'Did that seal her fate? According to Indian journalist Shyam Bhatia, a friend since her Oxford days, she had told him that that she was the mother of her nation\u2019s missile programme. In the investigative podcast, Bennett-Jones mentions that during her first stint as prime minister, Benazir was prevented from visiting the nation\u2019s nuclear sites.', u'What sealed Benazir Bhutto\u2019s fate?', u'On the whole, concerns about her intentions in this regard lie in the realm of pure speculation. There can be little doubt, though, that Benazir\u2019s planned return to the fray was indelibly wedded to Western interests. The deal with military dictator Pervez Musharraf was apparently brokered by the Blair and Bush administrations, the architects of the Afghanistan and Iraq disasters. A freedom-of-information request from Bennett-Jones to the UK Foreign Office in this regard was approved by the minister but thwarted by bureaucrats \u2014 he can\u2019t reveal his source for this insight.', u'Fair enough. But this echoes one of the more intriguing revelations in the podcast, namely that Gen Nadeem Taj, a close colleague of Musharraf\u2019s then recently appointed as head of the ISI, visited Benazir around midnight on the night before she was killed and advised her not to attend the Liaquat Bagh rally in Rawalpindi, on the basis that there was intelligence about an assassination attempt.', u'Taj was among the many military/intelligence personnel who refused to speak on the record with Bennett-Jones, but the latter gathers from sources whom Taj reportedly briefed that when Benazir asked why the purported culprits could not be arrested, he responded that this would compromise intelligence sources. She declared that she would go ahead. In that case, we will do our best to protect you, Taj is said to have replied.', u'In the event, it clearly wasn\u2019t enough. There were 1,300 police at the site, but few were visible after the deadly blast. There were metal detectors at entrances to the venue, as well as sniffer dogs and personnel who checked the stage. But the teenage assassin, Bilal, had determined that the target would be most vulnerable when she emerged from the rally and, as was her wont, raised her head above the parapet from her vehicle.', u'Bennett-Jones questions both PPP security chief Rehman Malik and party luminary Farhatullah Babar on why their back-up vehicle left the blast scene without bothering to ascertain what had happened to their leader. Both claim that they were asked to move on by the police. Babar said they were assured Benazir\u2019s SUV would follow them. It didn\u2019t, but no one bothered to stop and investigate. One of the doctors who tried in vain to resuscitate her, within an hour of the attack, was the son of a doctor who had attended to Liaquat Ali Khan after he was shot at almost the same spot in 1951.', u'One of the key controversies in the podcast relates to a phone call Benazir purportedly received from Musharraf while on a mission to secure US security backing. She perceived it as a threat. He denies making the call. Nothing can be verified. Benazir subsequently persisted in her efforts to obtain American protection, even at the obvious cost of being perceived as a Western puppet. Her conversation with US journalist Ron Suskind is revelatory. Blackwater never got involved, though.', u'The podcast might as well have been titled The Chronicle of a Death Foretold. It ended in a monumental tragedy, but was the idiotic Anglo-American plot that led to this carnage really worth it? Had Benazir been sensible enough to turn down the absurd proposition, she would have lived to tell the tale herself.'], 'link': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1393720/death-wish', 'heading': u'Death wish?'}

{'date': u' March 07, 2018', 'text': [u'\t\t\t\n', u'GOOD or bad, the Senate election is over, defying all conspiracy theories. Notwithstanding a few upsets, the results were largely predictable though there are some shouts of foul play. The PML-N may have emerged as the single largest party in the house by sweeping almost all the seats up for grabs in Punjab and a few more in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa but the battle for the control of the upper house is far from over. ', u'It is certainly not going to be easy for the ruling party to have its nominee elected as Senate chairman despite the combined numerical strength of its coalition partners. Horse-trading is the name of the game and the outcome is extremely unpredictable. The PML-N\u2019s endeavour to get control of both houses of parliament is not likely to succeed with the dice heavily cast against it. ', u'Pakistan\u2019s Senate elections have all that is manifest in the country\u2019s flawed democratic process. Candidates are mostly handpicked by all powerful party heads. Cronies are accommodated in the house. Loyalties are shifted overnight and one is not surprised to see the turncoats returning to the house under a different party banner each time. Money can buy a party ticket or even a seat in the august house standing as an independent. The latest election has not been any different to what we have witnessed in the past, raising questions about the sanctity of the elected forum representing the federation. ', u'What happened in the latest election does not come as a surprise \u2014 not even the PPP winning two seats and coming very close to snapping up a third one in KP with only seven members in the provincial legislature. While losing one in its stronghold, the PTI staged the biggest upset in Punjab by snatching one seat from the PML-N. The sweep of the so-called independent group in Balochistan too was foretold after the recent political re-engineering in the province. ', u'While crying foul, political leaders are still not willing to reform the system.', u'Predictably, the fragmentation of the MQM came as a boon to the PPP, allowing the party to stay in the game of thrones. Billions of rupees allegedly changed hands to purchase the Fata seats. Now these newly elected members may be up for sale to the highest bidder in the election for Senate chairman. ', u'Interestingly, both the PML-N and the PTI are calling for investigation into the vote-purchase allegation. But it is for these parties to look into their own ranks for the wrongdoers. It\u2019s not just about money being used to buy votes; in some cases the upset has also been caused by the revolt within the ranks against the choice of candidates by the party leaders. ', u'In KP particularly, the upset had also to do with the protest against the PTI\u2019s choice \u2014 not based on merit but on other considerations \u2014 of some candidates. The humiliating defeat of Maulana Samiul Haq who was being supported by the PTI is one such example. Similarly, in Punjab, PML-N members rejected Zubair Gul who was handpicked by Nawaz Sharif for his services to the family. The MQM leadership has only itself to blame for the debacle it has experienced. ', u'While crying foul, political leaders are still not willing to reform the system and make their party more democratic in order to stop the corrupt practices. ', u'There have also been questions regarding the PML-N\u2019s awarding tickets to Ishaq Dar who has been declared absconder by an accountability court. The former finance minister is also facing graft charges. Another one on the PML-N list is Rana Maqbool, a notorious retired senior police officer who had been accused of torturing Asif Ali Zardari when the latter was under detention. Their election certainly does not add to the prestige of the Senate.', u'The PPP can be rightly criticised for many wrongdoings, but to its credit, the party sends relatively more credible members to the Senate. It is highly commendable for the party to have had a Hindu woman, Krishna Kumari, elected, and that too on a general seat. The PPP members have traditionally been more active in the house, initiating debate on important national issues. The Senate will miss people like Farhatullah Babar and some other members who have now completed their term. ', u'Now begins the second phase of the battle for the control of the upper house that may also cast a long shadow over the coming general elections. A combined opposition can block the PML-N, though it seems unlikely that the PTI will join hands with the PPP. Interestingly, the newly formed independent bloc in Balochistan has emerged as the main powerbroker staking its claim for the top slot. ', u'One would not be surprised if the group\u2019s demand wins the support of both the PPP and the PTI; it may even divide the ruling coalition. Such a move could effectively block the PML-N\u2019s bid to capture the coveted post that the party deems critical for its plan to change the Constitution in order to quash Nawaz Sharif\u2019s disqualification. ', u'A person-specific amendment would not be acceptable to other mainstream political parties. It still remains to be seen how the PML-N plays its cards in case it fails to rally the support of the other parties for its candidate. The field is open and it is going to be a tough battle. The PML-N would sail through if the PTI and PPP remain divided. ', u'Indeed, the Senate election has removed the uncertainty surrounding the general elections and the second transition from one elected government to another. It bodes well for the democratic process in the country. But what happens over the next few weeks could change the political dynamics yet again. It is imperative to reform the system to establish the credibility of the elected institutions. ', u'Allegations of horse-trading and the purchase of votes have tarnished the image of parliament. Instead of accusing others of wrongdoing, it is time for political leaders themselves to strengthen democracy within and outside their parties. Those purchasing their way to parliament and fugitives from the law cannot uphold the sanctity of the Constitution and democratic values.'], 'link': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1393723/senate-election-horse-trading', 'heading': u'Senate election and horse-trading'}

", u'Perched in the Oval Office, the 71-year-old president was uncharacteristically cautious. ', u"\u201cI don't want to talk so much about things that we don't know yet,\u201d he said, holding out for clarity about a seemingly enticing offer from Pyongyang.

', u"It could also fuel divisions within Trump's own administration, where National Security Advisor HR McMaster has reportedly taken a harder line in favour of military action than Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. ", u'Having lost a string of his most senior aides, including economic advisor Gary Cohn, Trump can hardly afford more resignations in protest. ', u'Even if North Korea is serious, according to Medeiros it is not clear that Trump, who is without an ambassador to Seoul, lost his nuclear special envoy and has hollowed out the State Department, has the wherewithal to engage in real talks and simultaneously keep the coalition pressing North Korea intact. ', u'Most analysts said Pyongyang won a decisive public relations victory over the US at the Olympics last month when Vice President Mike Pence appeared open to talks but North Koreans and South Koreans actually met. ', u"Trump's other options are stark. ", u'US officials privately admit that a \u201cbloody nose\u201d strike mooted to chasten Kim away from nukes or ballistic missile tests was never under serious consideration.

', u'Diplomacy would seem a better option, but Trump has made clear that unlike his predecessors, he will not let the situation \u201cfester".

', u"During Trump's first visit to the Oval Office in November 2016, then-president Obama warned him he may have to make a fateful decision about North Korea, according to those familiar with the talks. ", u'What he does now in the Oval Office could help decide whether this decades-long nuclear standoff ends on the battlefield or at the negotiating table. ', u'But as George W.

He would always insist that I share the food with him. ', u'Jam was from a small village, Jhanji, in the furthest confines of Tharpakar, only a few kilometres from the Indian border.

And travelling from Chachro to Mirpurkhas in those days was like going by train from Karachi to Lahore, to say nothing of Hyderabad, which felt like some light years away.', u'\t\t\t\n', u'How did Jam become a communist? When I asked him, he replied that metal is always attracted by magnet. ', u'He was a voracious reader. Apart from Sindhi, he read a lot in Urdu as well as English. One book he liked a lot and gave everyone to read was the Urdu translation of ', u', a novel set in a Nazi-controlled concentration camp.

', u'All the three LNG projects were required to achieve commercial operation date (COD) on combined cycle by December 2017 under revised schedule instead of original schedule of June-August 2017, but are yet to reach that stage, he said. One of the plants may achieve COD on March 7, he added.', u'He said the LNG off-takers were either not ready or a few others had lower requirement for LNG while pipelines and storages were fully packed and hence the only option left was to reduce throughput from both terminals. ', u'The information flowed out after Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi presided over a meeting on power sector demand and supply situation ahead of coming summer when the PML-N performance in terms of ending loadshedding would come to real test. This has become crucial for the fact that PML-N would not be in power in peak summer to manage power situation and unfriendly hands on machines could crumble the power sector success story.', u'The meeting was attended by Minister for Power Sardar Awais Ahmed Khan Leghari, Finance Adviser Miftah Ismail, Special Assistant to the PM Barrister Zafarullah Khan, federal secretaries senior officials of divisions concerned. The meeting was also \u201cbriefed on demand and supply situation and the power generation projections from March till October 2018\u201d.', u'Interestingly, the LNG supply jack up was particularly based on power plants\u2019 requirement. The Central Power Purchase Agency (CPPA) and National Transmission & Despatch Company (NTDC) have been giving gas demand of up to 900mmcfd, but actual consumption in the sector has been less than 500mmcfd.', u'For February, the power sector has been committing LNG offtake of 700mmcfd, but the supply remained less than 400mmcfd and some quantities were diverted to the domestic sector besides the industry.', u'Under revised schedules, the Petroleum Ministry official said the two LNG projects of the federal government namely Haveli Bahadar Shah and Balloki and Qaid-i-Azam Power Plant (Bhikki plan) of Punjab government have confirmed combined cycle commissioning in early March (all three having 1,200MW). ', u'The three plants were to get firm supply of RLNG from December/January for combined cycle testing but they have so far failed to scale up supplies due to repeated technical failures. ', u'In fact, the three were to start single cycle operations over one year ago for which two LNG terminals were set up and LNG import arrangements were put in place at the expense of millions of dollars of the taxpayer money. The plants were to make \u2018take or pay\u2019 payments to LNG importers under back-to-back agreements in case of non-consumption of RLNG even in single cycle phase.', u'However, the stakeholders in the supply chain have refrained from \u2018take or pay\u2019 settlement under orders of the PM Office to spread the losses across the chain instead of cost build up in LNG power plants to avoid Nandipur Power project-like cost escalations. The cost, therefore, shift to PSO, LNG companies and Sui gas companies besides the consumer at large. LNG terminal operators like Elengy and Gasport are qualified to claim full payments that increases the processing cost because of lower utilisation factor.', u'Interestingly, chief executive of Qaid-i-Azam LNG project Ahad Cheema was picked up by National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in a different case when his first plant at Bhikki was in final stage of testing and he had been entrusted to undertake fourth LNG project of 1,200MW at Trimmu when it had become clear that enough generation capacity had been contracted.', u'In the meanwhile, a number of low-cost generation project based on coal and hydropower have come on line like coal-based project at Sahiwal contributing 1,300MW, Port Qasim coal plant 600MW and expected to go up to 1,300MW soon. Additional nuclear power capacity of around 800MW is likely to be commissioned this summer while Tarbela-4th extension will give enhanced supplies in summer, followed by Neelum-Jehulm.', u'These low-cost projects would shift all LNG-based projects way down on merit order and compel these plants to full capacity utilisation in peak summer. \u201cThis is the story of unsustainable development taking place without proper coordination among various stakeholders\u201d, said an insider.', u'An official statement said the Wapda chairman briefed the prime minister about the updated satiation vis-\xe0-vis payments made so far to Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa against net hydel profit claims. He said Wapda had met all its net hydel payments obligations even when it had not yet received the funds from CPPA after determination by National Electric Power Regulatory Authority.

Here being a place where I found fashion dull, uninspiring and insipid.', u'I grew up mostly in Pakistan, and there was a time when the fashion world was great here. Musarat Nazir was considered just as stylish as Tahira Saeed, as was Madam Noor Jehan. Marina Khan with her cropped hair was every much a style icon as Sahira Kazmi with her long tresses.', u'Back in college, there was a girl who rocked the short shirt and ', u', one who rocked skinny jeans, one who wore the hijab in the most stylish way ever. I liked that world.', u'\t\t\t\n', u'2010 onward we saw a shift in the local fashion scene. We saw the advent of social media that started with people casually posting photos of themselves to it becoming a professional platform with digital influencers and bloggers. Suddenly everybody had a platform, and what a joyous thing that \u2026 could\u2019ve been.', u"Instead of using it as a platform to celebrate and develop everyone's individuality, our Instagram and fashion sense turned into what looks like the fastest moving assembly line in China, making a dull product, with a craft level so diminutive that elementary robots could run it.", u' It is a template really, with a few basic steps to follow:', u' Get your hair dyed yellow. Please make sure it is the \u201csame shade\u201d as hers, might as well go the same hairdresser. Just make sure it matches.', u' Get a blow-dry, with loose curls at the bottom. That shall now be your hairstyle, for today and tomorrow and forever. Ok fine, maybe once in a blue moon, you shall get a high pony too.', u' Wear whatever; as long as it is branded, nobody cares if it looks good or makes you feel comfortable - just focus on it being \u201cIN\u201d. Also, a foolproof method to look fashionable is to show some skin. Like I said, nobody cares what the event or where the bulge in question is, just do it.', u' Conceal, conceal, conceal! Your moles, scars, uneven skin tone that is all very unnatural and shall not be accepted.', u' And in the end, the most important step: your bag! Now listen carefully, unless you carry a designer bag, nobody will want to be your friend. If you are like me and don\u2019t know much about international designers, just get the bag SHE HAS\u2026 That cool girl who does it naturally, just zoom into one of her photos and on your next trip to Dubai, get that EXACT SAME bag. Or plan B, find the first copy in Thailand or a third one at Liberty Market; that might do the trick too.', u"Now that you're all set, pose uncomfortably, place that bag in front of yourself and there you go, you shall now make it to at least five Instagram handles, \u201clooking fabulous\u201d.", u'That was the world I found myself in. A world where if, God forbid, one person goes and gets a certain experimental haircut, 30 people follow; not out of inspiration but of the incessant need to copy-paste (and the belief that style can be copy-pasted). A world where summer wardrobes are no longer a fun, creative process of designing outfits you like, but a race based on who wears who, first.', u'\t\t\t\n', u'I have had the misfortune of knowing someone who boastfully told me: "My maid owns all of last year\u2019s lawn designs" (her charitable self only a garb for \u201cI don\u2019t wear last year\u2019s designs, sister!\u201d). Statements such as, \u201c', u'\u201d or \u201c', u'\u201d have become so common, people don\u2019t even see what\u2019s wrong with them.', u"Sadly, it's become a world where fashion journalism too, slipped into a space that lacked both opinion and vocabulary. ", u'Everything is \u201cfabulous\u201d and \u201camazing\u201d and everyone looks \u201cchic\u201d and \u201clovely\u201d; I am not saying we should criticise people for their fashion choices, but I am saying, I\u2019d rather you not say anything. If they are looking uncomfortable, if they are all looking more of the same, our praise then only helps to dig the hole deeper.', u'\t\t\t\n', u'But before I got bored, much like everyone else, I got confused. ', u"For a bit in the middle, I thought, 'okay so this is the new world order and I must comply to keep up'. So I got the gold highlights, I got the blow-dries, the stilettos and did the awkward poses\u2026 some evidence of this phase still exists online and I am glad it does, it is there to forever remind me of what happens when you try and become someone else.", u'This constant lack of validation exhausted me and I realised I had to take a step back. And so, I sat out two years trying to find that girl again who wore her red shoes everywhere. It helped to surround myself with artists who couldn\u2019t care less if you wore your pajamas to work every day.', u'I remember feeling underconfident and just plain unhappy, regardless of how much money or effort I put into \u201cmy look\u201d. I didn\u2019t look like myself, I didn\u2019t feel like myself, and even if others told me I looked nice, nice is not how I felt within.', u'This constant lack of validation exhausted me and I realised I had to take a step back. And so, I sat out two years trying to find that girl again who wore her red shoes everywhere. Over two years, as I wore the same clothes over and over, and over again: the same jeans and sneakers, the brown satchel with my uncombed hair... my switch from fashion to films, helped - I was behind the camera and could just be myself.', u'\t\t\t\n', u'It helped to surround myself with artists who couldn\u2019t care less if you wore your pajamas to work every day. Sure, some loved ones were concerned about why I would refuse to dress up or put in an effort, but I assured them, all will be well. And slowly, it was.', u'I figured it really wasn\u2019t even in the clothes so much. Your personal sense of style, if you let it, shines through regardless. ', u'That the point of fashion isn\u2019t social validation, it is finding comfort and strength in how you present yourself to the world. I found out that I am the girl who is okay owning one pair of shoes and wearing them with every outfit. I found out that I don\u2019t like combing my hair, that I don\u2019t particularly enjoy putting on lipstick and I now wear a sports bra under pretty much every outfit.', u'\t\t\t\n', u'Some days when I feel like it, I put some sexy clothes on and in my head I\u2019m looking like Beyonc\xe9, but it is my version of sexy. To admire someone\u2019s sense of style doesn\u2019t have to be the same as copying it; because the problem is, you can\u2019t, especially if it\u2019s Beyonc\xe9. Why let fashion become a stressful job of trying to look better? A competitive sport whereas all it is meant to be is \u2018means\u2019.', u'The point of fashion isn\u2019t social validation, it is finding comfort and strength in how you present yourself to the world.', u'I hate \u2018hate pieces,\u2019 this isn\u2019t one. I have nothing against yellow hair or red or green, I also have nothing against designer bags, heck I wish I owned one... (okay no, shoes, Gucci shoes, that\u2019s what I wish for)... I just have a problem with the image of an unhappy, underconfident woman, trying hard to fit in, to stand out. ', u'I just miss my girl gang, where each one had something to say, and said it loud and clear.', u'Am I getting closer to reclaiming that space? Maybe. As Leandra Medine says: \u201cFashion is so much more than just clothing for the people who feel they can let it in; it can become the greatest sum of her parts, a megaphone for articulation where words simply will not work. It can be a drug-free boost that makes a terrible day seem slightly better, a reminder through the depths of desperation that even if nothing else is going as I\u2019ve planned, I\u2019m armed."'], 'link': 'https://images.dawn.com/news/1179604/why-fashion-in-pakistan-started-to-bore-me-and-how-i-bounced-back', 'heading': u'Why fashion in Pakistan started to bore me (and how I bounced back)'}

', u'The Customs Agents Association has written to three private terminal operators asking for waiver of all charges for the vehicles that were stranded on their premises. The vehicles could not be cleared due to changes in the clearing rules that took effect while the automobiles were in transit to Karachi port. The operators include Al Hamd, Pak Shaheen Container Services, and National Logistics Cell (NLC). ', u'\u201cWe have spoken to customs authorities and they have agreed to grant us a delayed detention certificate, after which the terminal operators are legally required to give us a waiver on demurrage charges,\u201d Mohammad Aamir, Secretary General of the Karachi Customs Agents Association told Dawn. He estimated the total amount of demurrage charges being applied to lie in a range from Rs500 million to Rs1 billion. ', u'Huge demurrage charges have accrued while vehicles are stuck at port due to changes in clearing rules', u'\u201cThis is a burden on trade,\u201d he said referring to the charges. \u201cThis is a kind of trade after all, even the used car showroom owners, after all, that is also a trade in a sense\u201d. ', u'The Customs Act of 1969, under Section 14A (2) mandates a refund or waiver of all demurrage charges \u201creceived on account of delay because of no fault of the importers or exporters\u201d. This section of the Act was the subject of litigation between the three large terminal operators of Karachi \u2014 Qasim International Container Ter\xadminal (QICT), Pakistan International Container Terminal (PICT), and Karachi International Container Terminal (KICT) \u2014 in a case that was filed in November 2013. One of the prayers moved by the petitioners in that case was to \u201cdeclare Section 14A of the Customs Act 1969 is unconstitutional and void ab initio.\u201d The court granted the request in a short order, so the legality of any case built on the said section is now in doubt. ', u'Most of the cars in the dispute are imported under the baggage or transfer of residence scheme, a facility meant only returning expatriates. In noting the widespread abuse of this facility for commercial purposes, the Ministry of Commerce imposed new rules for clearing of vehicles under the schemes that required payment of all duties and taxes on these imports to be made from bank accounts that are in the name of the person shown as the importer. ', u'Those rules practically shut the trade down, leaving up to 10,000 cars stranded at the ports for months till February 23, when the government bowed to the demands of the importers and customs agents and reversed the rules. \u201cThe reason is that our local auto industry is not able to meet the requirement of our local markets for cars\u201d said Aamir, when asked how cars imported under these schemes could be said to be part of \u201ctrade and industry\u201d. ', u'Local assemblers are giving up to six month delivery times, he said, \u201cand look at where the own money has gone now\u201d. He claimed the government reopened these schemes for commercial importers keeping mind the inability of local auto assemblers to meet the skyrocketing demand for automobiles.

{'date': u' March 06, 2018', 'text': [u'\t\t\t\n', u'KARACHI: On a sunny weekend afternoon, the road leading to New Rizvia Society in Karachi\u2019s Safoora Goth area has very thin traffic. A huge billboard overlooking the visitors at the society\u2019s main gate demands the recovery of Engineer Syed Mumtaz Hussain Rizvi. Rizvi\u2019s wife and nephew talk and share the details of his disappearance in the living room, decorated with religious inscriptions and photos. ', u'Rizvi ran a business of computer hardware and was on a \u201cbusiness trip\u201d to Quetta in January, when he lost contact with his family on the 23rd of that month. His wife, Zehra, recalls the day when she last talked to her husband. ', u'\u201cHe had said that he was going to be in Karachi by 9pm. We waited for him throughout the night, and when he didn\u2019t show up, we inquired his friends, partners, and other acquaintances, but he was nowhere to be found,\u201d she says. \u201cI last talked to him at 5.30pm that day, and his mobile phone went off shortly afterwards. We are not in contact with him since then.\u201d ', u'The family then approached the Sachal police station, which registered a complaint \u2014 not an FIR. \u201cWe have also filed a petition in the Sindh High Court where our case has been heard once, and the next hearing is on March 8.\u201d The complaint filed says that he had \u201cleft home for work on Jan 23, but didn\u2019t return\u201d, which is different from the narrated story according to which he was returning from Quetta. She attributes the discrepancy to the fact that the family at that time \u201cdidn\u2019t know where he went missing from. We don\u2019t know his last whereabouts to this day\u201d, says his wife.', u'\u2018Holding someone in illegal confinement is a violation of human rights\u2019', u'A doctoral student at a private university in Karachi, Rizvi also served in the editorial board of a monthly Urdu magazine which carried scientific and educational articles. The disappearance of the father of five \u2014 four daughters and a son \u2014 has traumatised the family. \u201cEducation of my children is suffering and so is our daily routine; our lives have been completely altered after this incident,\u201d says Zehra. \u201cTo this day, we have received no phone call or any piece of information from any person, group or law enforcement agency which would inform us about him.\u201d', u'The family stresses that he was not part of any religious or political party, concerned with only \u201cwelfare work\u201d. ', u'\t\t\t\n', u'\u201cHe used to help people in need and kept others before himself. How could a man with such a busy schedule be involved in any [subversive] activity?\u201d, she questions, demanding that he be produced in court with all available evidence if he was wanted by the state.', u'Boys are winding up their game of cricket in a street in Abbas Town, a Shia neighbourhood in Karachi\u2019s Gulshan-i-Iqbal area. The home of Syed Samar Abbas is not difficult to locate as it is fairly close to a community clinic-cum-mosque. Some children of the family are studying in a courtyard as Abbas\u2019s brother, Ghazanfer, talks to this writer. Abbas, he says, was on a routine trip to Islamabad for his \u201cbusiness-related\u201d work in January 2017\u2019s first week. Jan 7 was the day when the family last heard from Abbas, who has been missing since. ', u'Father of three, Abbas had previously worked as an IT professional in Saudi Arabia, and had returned to Pakistan a few years ago, after which he had set up his own software development business. It was in this connection that he had been to Islamabad from where he never returned. The FIR registered at Ramna police station of the federal capital quotes his family that he was last known to be in Sector G-11. ', u'His disappearance coincided with the disappearance of online activists in early 2017, most of whom made it back to their homes shortly afterwards, but Abbas\u2019s trail has only grown colder over time. The family insists that Abbas\u2019s case was not in any way connected with that of the online activists. ', u'\u201cAbbas was a field activist who used to work for community welfare, and had good coordination with the law enforcement agencies\u201d, says Ghazanfer. His father, an income-tax adviser at the Lahore High Court, has been ailing and so is his mother; his parents demand the recovery of their son. ', u'\u201cSindh Home Minister Sohail Anwar Siyal had assured us that he will be recovered when we marched for his recovery back in October 2017\u201d, says his mother, adding that they had contacted the National Commission for Human Rights, and Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearance \u2014 informally known as the Justice Javed Iqbal Commission \u2014 but they had received no positive news yet. ', u'The family of the 40-year-old has also filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court for his recovery, but no headway has been made. Like Rizvi\u2019s family, Abbas\u2019s family also said that they wanted to see him tried in court if he was involved in any act of sabotage. \u201cHe was a loving father, a caregiver to his ailing parents, and a patriotic citizen, his disappearance has pushed his children and us in a perpetual state of trauma.\u201d ', u'Senior official of Sindh Police\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) Raja Umar Khattab says that the two missing persons were not in the custody of the CTD. \u201cWe have a system in place, through which we legally arrest the suspects, and produce them in court,\u201d he says, adding that he had no knowledge of the whereabouts of the mentioned persons as his unit was not dealing with the matter. \u201cAbbas had helped law enforcement in producing witnesses in some cases a while back, however, the CTD doesn\u2019t have any intelligence on his disappearance.\u201d', u'On the other hand, vice chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) Sindh chapter, Asad Iqbal Butt believes that the so-called \u2018missing persons\u2019 were in custody of law enforcement agencies. He estimates that about 150 people were missing from Sindh of which about 60 hailed from Karachi. He said that a fair trial was the basic right of all the citizens, and holding someone in illegal confinement was a violation of human rights. \u201cActivities like these bring bad name to otherwise respectable institutions, therefore if [the persons] have done anything wrong, let the courts decide the matter,\u201d Butt says.

Contreras-Sweet\u2019s buyout offer had presented the best hope for avoiding that fate. But the deal was plunged into turmoil after New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a lawsuit against the studio last month.', u'The announcement came just days after Contreras-Sweet and the Weinstein Co. revived the deal following arduous negotiations with Schneiderman. It marks the second time in two weeks that the sale has been called off. The first time, it was the Weinstein Co. that pulled out, announcing it would file for bankruptcy protection because the buyers had failed to live up to commitments.

', u'Inside, his son Sajid is fighting for his life. Lying in the intensive care unit, the 24-year-old\u2019s face is swollen, his legs wrapped in casts, and his body covered in bruises. Blood drips into a small bottle hanging by his left leg.', u'\u201cThe days are starting to meld together,\u201d says Abid Masih, when I ask him how long he has been here.', u'On Feb 23, Sajid Masih threw himself from a fourth-floor window at the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Lahore headquarters during an interrogation into blasphemy charges. His cousin, Patras, 21, stands accused of having shared an allegedly blasphemous image to a Facebook messenger group. Sajid was called in for a digital forensic examination of his phone, to ascertain whether the image had been sent to him. During the examination, Sajid struggled with investigators, made a dash for the window, paused for a moment, and then jumped.', u'That Sajid jumped, and did not intend to survive the fall is a fact. Why he did so, however, remains open to a great deal of dispute.', u'Investigators say they were about to begin the examination of Sajid\u2019s phone when he panicked and threw himself out of the window. Sajid tells a markedly different story. His lawyer quotes the young man as saying that he was repeatedly beaten and accused of having committed blasphemy. ', u'\u201cThey beat him with computer wires and slapped and punched him,\u201d says Aneeqa Maria, the lawyer. Four FIA officials then attempted to force Sajid to perform oral sex on Patras, Maria says. \u201cThey forced him, and then he said no, and he begged for forgiveness.\u201d', u'His father completes the story: \u201cSajid said that he would rather die than do this. That is why he jumped.\u201d', u'Back at the family\u2019s home in the Baba Bandook Saeein neighbourhood of the village of Dhair, about 20km from the centre of Lahore, the streets are quiet. The narrow concrete lanes, many of them broken from wear, form a tight grid, with dozens of brick houses crowded together. There is sewage in many of the streets, and the smell of faeces is overpowering, as those left in the neighbourhood gather to recall what happened on the afternoon of Feb 19.', u'\u201cWe fled in fear,\u201d says Parveen Bibi, 70, who has lived here for decades. \u201cWe were afraid we would have been beaten, or that they would have broken into our homes.\u201d', u'That day, scores of angry protesters stormed the neighbourhood, demanding that Patras Masih be produced. When it became clear that Patras had already fled the neighbourhood, they brought cans of petrol to burn it down.', u'\u201cWhen I came home from work, I saw a lot of people gathered, raising slogans. They were shouting that a blasphemer can never be forgiven,\u201d says Waris Masih, 54, a labourer.', u'Most of the neighbourhood\u2019s roughly 800 Christians hurriedly left the area. Later that night, Patras surrendered himself to the police.', u'Blasphemy allegations are often linked to existing disputes, either between individuals or communities. In this case, however, it is unclear whether such a dispute existed. ', u'\u201cRelations with the Muslims have always been good here, in the past,\u201d said Inderias Masih, Patras\u2019 father. The only such dispute he could think of was a fight between Muslim and Christian youths over playing space at a nearby cricket field, three months ago.', u'Most residents of Baba Bandook Saeein lack property deeds or any formal paperwork linked to their homes, Maria, the lawyer, says, suggesting a land grab may have been the motive.', u'There is, however, another possibility.', u'The Tehreek Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah (TLYRA), a religious group led by firebrand cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi, has championed the accuser\u2019s case, stepping in to lodge the FIR in the name of local office holder Muhammad Owais. TLYRA posters are visible all over the Muslim parts of Baba Bandook Saeein, advertising a local event where Rizvi was due to speak. Owais\u2019 name is prominent on the poster.', u'The TLYRA has been emboldened since it blocked a major highway into Islamabad for three weeks in November. Having emerged from that confrontation with all of its demands met, the organisation has been holding political rallies, fighting by-elections and making known its intention to fight in the 2018 general elections.', u'\u201cWe have always been very clear about our position on blasphemy,\u201d says Ejaz Ashrafi, the group\u2019s information secretary. \u201cAfter the Faizabad sit-in, people have now heard about us a lot more. Our position is the same, but now people are much more drawn to us.\u201d', u'However, moments after denying that the TLYRA was involved in the mob attack on the village, Ashrafi also threatens that anyone who, in their view, commits blasphemy should not consider themselves safe. ', u'Back at the FIA headquarters, their understanding of the motive behind the case is somewhat different.', u'\u201c[Patras] has given a sacrifice, so that the rest of his family can now be relocated and seek asylum in any other country,\u201d says Khwaja Hammad, an FIA deputy director. \u201cBut not Patras.

{'date': u'March 06, 2018', 'text': [u'\t\t\t\n', u'ALTHOUGH the Senate election is finally concluded despite all the apprehensions expressed over the past one year regarding a possible postponement on one ground or the other, the allegations about big money being used to lure provincial and national legislators to vote in a certain way continue to reverberate. The media has been awash with stories of \u2018horse-trading\u2019 and money changing hands. No evidence is produced in support of such claims but candidates winning without sufficient votes from their respective parties is cited as the major ground for such allegations. ', u'For example, the PPP won at least two additional seats in Sindh, apparently with the support of MQM MPAs. It also managed to win two seats in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa despite its relatively small number of MPAs there. The PTI won a seat in Punjab which could only be possible with the votes from the MPAs of other parties adding to PTI votes', u'It is, however, important to point out that although most of the legislators vote in the Senate elections along party lines, the law does not bind them to do so. The law requires MNAs and MPAs to vote in the Senate election through secret ballot and that is why voting against party direction in these elections is not considered defection and hence not grounds for disqualification. Even in India, where the Rajya Sabha election is conducted through an open ballot and state legislators are allowed to show their ballot to their authorised party representatives before casting it, voting against party direction is not considered defection. ', u'The framers of the election laws, therefore, did not envisage a vote strictly along party lines and an allowance seems to have been made for conscience voting. It is, therefore, not correct to assume that voting against party lines was automatically motivated by personal gains. The allegations of money-for-votes, however, seem more plausible in some cases, especially where party discipline has weakened as in the case of the MQM or where voters are independent such as in Fata. The allegations of \u2018horse-trading\u2019 are considered serious enough that Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and PTI chairman Imran Khan have openly and forcefully called for a change in the system of Senate elections. It is unlikely that such a change will be possible in the short run but the question of placing adequate checks and controls on the role of money in politics has very much taken centre stage and will need to be addressed.', u'A major question left unaddressed in the Elections Act pertains to the limit on poll spending.', u'The question of money in politics in general and of political finance in particular will assume much greater importance as we enter the active campaign period for the general elections scheduled no later than August this year. A major question that the Elections Act, 2017, has left unaddressed is the limit on election spending by political parties. ', u'Although our election laws have traditionally set limits on election spending by individual candidates and these limits have been considerably enhanced in the new law, there has never been a limit placed on election spending by political parties. This probably was not so much of an issue in the past when overall party spending was rather limited and almost all election-related expenses were incurred by the candidates, but over a period of time the dynamics of elections have changed. ', u'Political parties now play a much greater role and exercise a much greater influence on the election. As evidenced by the exit polls and through several other manifestations, the percentage of voters who vote based on party loyalties has steadily increased as politics matures in Pakistan. The expenses incurred by political parties have, therefore, also increased since the last three elections especially 2002 when the electronic media entered the electoral arena as a major player. ', u'Political parties are increasingly using electronic media for their direct and indirect political messaging. These advertisements are not constituency-specific and, therefore, spending on these cannot be technically and legally counted towards the spending for a particular constituency for which there is a limit prescribed by the law. Advertisements in the electronic media are generally a big-ticket item and usually constitute the single largest item in election spending. It is considered so exorbitant that in certain countries like the UK, election advertisements on electronic media are disallowed by the law. In some other countries like India, state television time is provided free of charge to political parties using certain criteria for determining the air time allowed to each party. ', u'It is because of these rather recent developments that an election spending limit on political parties is extremely important. Initial drafts of the Elections Act, 2017 did propose a limit of Rs200 million for each party but the final version omitted this. Giving a free hand to political parties in election spending will promote the influence of big money in politics with all its unhealthy effects.', u'With no limit on their spending, political parties will be tempted to tap into such sources of funding which may not be legal and/or ethical. At least one major political party in Pakistan has been under investigation and litigation on charges of foreign funding. Uncontrolled spending will generate extra pressure on parties to look for financiers who may have their own interests to serve through the cultivation of political parties. The election spending limit is, therefore, an important reform for consideration by all political parties.', u'Despite the lapse on political parties\u2019 election spending limit, electoral laws in Pakistan contain reasonable checks and limits on political finance. The lingering problem, however, has always been the lack of adequate capacity and will to enforce such laws by scrutinising such critical documents as the election expense returns, annual accounts submitted by political parties and statements of assets and liabilities submitted by candidates and legislators. It is critical that the Election Commission is supported in installing an effective political finance monitoring and enforcement secretariat adequately staffed by professionals well before the general election.'], 'link': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1393400/money-and-politics', 'heading': u'Money and politics'}

The main drivers of increased consumption were transport and power sectors with 12pc and 10pc, respectively.', u'Consumption of petrol in the transport sector saw an increase of 16pc due to the growing number of motorcycles and cars. Similarly, consumption of HSD grew by 10pc, mainly because of higher utilisation by the transport sector, indicating increased economic activities in the country.', u'The transport and power sectors consumed almost 90pc of total petroleum oil lubricant (POL), sharing 57pc and 33pc, respectively.

Add to it our worsening current account position and you can understand that being back on FATF watchlist is unfortunate for Pakistan.\u201d', u'But can the placement again on the watchlist amid changed geopolitical environment, rising trust deficit between the United States and Pakistan and our worsening external account turn out to be as inconsequent as the government wants to make us believe? Only time will tell.', u'Qaiser Ahmad Sheikh, chairman of the national Assembly\u2019s Standing Committee on Finance, Revenue and Economic Affairs, has expressed concern over a ballooning current account deficit amid growing stocks of external debt.', u'During a recent meeting, the committee noted that the country needs $7 billion within this fiscal year just to check the current account deficit that soared to $9.156bn in the first seven months of the current fiscal year from $6.182bn in the year-ago period.', u'Pakistan\u2019s overall external debt and liabilities jumped to nearly $89bn in December 2017 from a little less than $76bn in December 2016, pushing up the cost of external-debt financing and thus putting pressure on our balance of payments.', u'Expanding current account deficit, primarily owing to a high growth in the import bill, has shaved off $3.8bn (or about 23.5pc) from the central bank\u2019s forex reserves during this fiscal year. ', u'These reserves fell to $12.345bn on Feb 23 \u2014 barely enough to cover three months of imports \u2014 from $16.145bn at the end of June.', u'Growing external debt servicing that keeps depleting State Bank\u2019s reserves and the imminent FATF action can squeeze room for launching new editions of sovereign bonds at affordable rates.', u'Fresh borrowing from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for fixing balance of payments problems ahead of the elections is politically out of question. Moreover, the privatisation plan for massive state-run entities like Pakistan International Airlines and Pakistan Steel looks next to impossible.', u'Deteriorating external account, fiscal problems like a decline in the number of taxpayers, ballooning circular debt of the energy sector and growing domestic debt are all affecting overall economic growth. All indicators suggest that Pakistan would miss the 6pc GDP growth target during this fiscal year.', u'SBP Governor Tariq Bajwa said in a recent interview to a local daily that growth this year could reach to 5.8pc. Moody\u2019s in its Feb 28 report estimated that growth could be 5.5pc. It said that growth momentum is spurred by solid domestic demand and rising manufacturing output, infrastructure investment related to CPEC projects, and reforms achieved under the previous IMF programme.', u'The international credit rating service, however, warned that economic growth is susceptible to rising political tensions, renewed security and terrorist-related unrest and a weaker rupee reflecting a build-up of external pressures.', u'For central bankers and for other economic managers, too, a possible slippage of the growth target is perhaps not that important as is the sustainability of growth.', u'However, a lower than targeted growth means less jobs for people and less increase in income levels of ordinary Pakistanis. For political leaders, ensuring a growth closer to 6pc in an election year is more important than its sustainability in the medium to long run. They always love to leave the sustainability part for the next government to take care of.', u'That is where economic managers still feel constrained in implementing the policies that they believe are good in the long run.', u'\u201cIf you raise the policy rate by 25 basis points after keeping it stable for a long time ahead of general elections, it\u2019s not going to sink into political heads why it is necessary now,\u201d says a member of the monetary policy committee of the central bank.', u'The SBP raised its policy rate from 5.75pc in late January as a shock absorber of anticipated inflationary pressures. After the latest upward revision, local petroleum prices have already hit a three-year high. This could push up headline Consumer Price Index inflation in the coming months from 3.8pc in February even if GDP growth remains below the target as domestic consumers-led demand for goods and services remain high.', u'Interactions with executives of major local banks show that even after getting a prestigious B3-stable outlook from rating agency Moody\u2019s, our banks are apparently not feeling so cool. An uneasy calm prevails perhaps owing to pre-general election political uncertainty and looming FATF action in June.', u'Moody\u2019s said in its report that despite margin pressures banks\u2019 profitability would remain flat during this year.

Moreover, the country may also face increased transactions costs, restricted access to international financial market and the downgrading of its banking sector\u2019s rating.', u'The economic fallout of the listing is contextual. Speculating economic costs, therefore, must involve reasons expounded for and context of inclusion, economic and political state of the country and the likelihood of a successful demonstration of compliance in addition to compliance itself.', u'More than compliance, it is the demonstration of compliance that will decide how long we stay on the FATF watchlist and what economic costs we face', u'Being on the grey list may have varying impact across the countries and over time. Therefore, suggestions that there will be no economic impact based on the previous experience are generalised and political.', u'Pakistan was on the grey list during 2012 to 2015 on charges of money laundering. But this time around, the primary charge is terror financing. One can clearly understand that given the level of distrust, the response of the international community would be much strict this time.', u'Restrictions on Pakistan\u2019s access to the international financial market may be stricter this time than in the 2012-2015 period.', u'Rating agency Fitch has already revised the outlook on Pakistan\u2019s long-term foreign and local currency issuer default ratings to negative from stable on account of a partial reversal of gains made under a three-year IMF programme that ended in September 2016.', u'Other agencies like Standard and Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s are also likely to downgrade country\u2019s sovereign debt rating. The ongoing episode of political instability multiplies this risk. Financial institutions may tighten the lending or will add higher risk premium to markup. Both outcomes can put the economy in distress.', u'Given the fact that Pakistan is posting historically high trade deficits, the demand for borrowing is at the highest level. The deficit may further widen as the FATF watchlist may serve as non-tariff barrier to the country\u2019s exports.', u'The flow of foreign currency may also shrink. At the same time, any increase in the cost of borrowing would also hurt the economy. The impact is directly proportional to the size of the economy; therefore, it will be much bigger than the previous episode of 2012-2015 as Pakistan\u2019s current $300bn-plus economy needs a flow of resources to grow at 5pc.', u'Increased transaction cost and reputational loss also discourage foreign investment and the inflow of remittances. It is the foreign direct investment (FDI) that will suffer the most.', u'Capital is very sensitive to uncertainty. Already facing political instability, Pakistan may witness capital flight if it continues to be on the grey list for more than a year. ', u'This can cause a decline in government revenues and general economic activity.', u'If the listing period gets longer \u2014 for which odds are higher \u2014 we may end up going to the IMF. But the IMF, World Bank and other international lenders may play cold given the fact that the FATF motion comes from the United States. ', u'Being on the watchlist also has repercussions for Pakistan\u2019s banking sector. Rating agencies can demote ratings of individual banks, particularly those operating abroad. This may put the banks under strict regulations, thus reducing their overall competitiveness by increasing compliance costs.', u'In addition, foreign banks may leave the country or may increase the cost of borrowing to domestic and public sectors. Overall, it squeezes the chances of joint ventures. The corporate sector, particularly companies working with the United States and other western clients, will face a disproportionate setback.', u'Though the present listing may be politically motivated, compliance is mandatory for Pakistan. The cost of no reforms will be much higher than the cost of reforms.', u'A well-targeted diplomatic exchange needs to be structured to demonstrate to the global community in general and related authorities in particular that we are serious about curbing money laundering in all its forms and that we have zero tolerance for terror financing. We also need to exhibit it clearly that we are open to work with stakeholders in this regard.', u'More than compliance, it is the demonstration of compliance that will decide how long we stay in the list and what economic costs we face.

{'date': u' March 05, 2018', 'text': [u'THERE is the fable of the cat and the lion, where the lion asks the cat to show him all the tricks and techniques of planning and hunting. And then, when he has been taught supposedly everything, one day pounces on the cat itself only to see it dodge and climb a tree which the lion cannot. From the top of the tree the cat smiles down and says \u201cI may have taught you all the techniques but there is one I saved for my own survival.  And from there the term \u2018cat is the lion\u2019s aunt\u2019 (billi shair kee khaala) started.  ', u'Test cricket similarly may have passed on some tricks to the limited over format, first to 50 overs then to 40 and onwards to 20 to 10. But even as the lion roars the cat holds some cards close to its chest. And that is the tension of a third result, the fighting last session and often the chance of four results as the game nears its end.', u'You see, Test cricket is a game of strategy and the grueling fight. Comparing it with the shorter formats is like comparing coffee poured dry from sachets with brewed and stirred cappuccino. Yes life is quick and the attention spans are shorter. Editors now even go for shorter paragraphs and shorter lengths of articles. Yet the novel still sells twice more than the book of short stories according to publishers data. ', u'Fears of the world\u2019s end has reverberated at every entrepreneurial turn. When video came experts called it the death of cinema. Actually, even before video and subsequently DVD\u2019s faded out due to online viewing, cinema sales boosted. This was because with special effects, cinematography and wardrobe classics audiences still wanted to see it on the big screen. And cinema owners went for an environment that the shorter format couldn\u2019t match, such as surround sound and 3D.', u'Even the late 70s song by Video Killed The Radio Star by Bugglesbecame untrue as more cars on the road meant higher audiences for FM radio and then the disrupter effect of mobiles and iPods (especially in Pakistan) lead to equal chance for songs to be heard while riding, driving or walking. ', u'Coming back to Test cricket, I doubt if any shorter format game could match the tension of the dying moments of the third and final Test in the West Indies last year where Pakistan won with a handful of balls to spare. No shorter format could match the tension of dying moments when only one side could win. ', u'Moreover, statistics prove that large majority of shorter format games lack interest after the opening few overs of the second innings. Take the currently on PSL. It has been low scoring games and ever so often the result is probable by the powerplay in the second innings. Often in fact the first innings scores of 100 odd make it quicker than that. That makes it equal to a session of Test cricket where you not only see some quality batting and bowling but also the unraveling of a plot. ', u'Test cricket also has the option of being viewed at one\u2019s leisure. You have five days with three sessions each to catch the action. With Test cricket normally going for over three runs an over these days there is enough happening. The five day game also has the charm of fielders around the bat especially to spinners. That is a trap waiting to happen and the spinner knits his web like he cannot in a one day game. There the captain will not allow him to buy his wicket.', u'The five day game sees several oscillations that keep the interest alive. There is a second innings where the game can swing on its head. Can any shorter format match the way India, after following on 274 behind posted 657 and won in 2001. Or when Asad Shafiq batted like a warrior to almost see Pakistan chase close to 500 in the day night Test in Australia in December 2016. Likewise Younus\u2019 double hundred at The Oval earlier that summer turned around a match and series result. Countless other reversals show the true attraction of Test cricket.', u'Some teams have actually managed to do a fine balancing act of all formats and India admittedly is perhaps the best at it. The IPL may have sounded the horn on T20 cricket following the experiment on English grounds but Indians have played their role in endorsing Test cricket as a full value format. That may be due to their academies and the exposure their cricketers have got but it is also because of the intrinsic value they place on the war plan as against the battle tactic.', u'They are taking their Test cricket seriously leading to a greater following. Their recent fightback in the Test series in South Africa on alien tracks shows that their batsmen and bowlers are not just T20 hitters or containers. They took on their own Bishen Bedi\u2019s comments that they will be in for a beating and showed him up in all formats. ', u'Yes there are players shying away from the five day game to maintain their fitness for the more lucrative domestic T20 leagues, but if you notice these are almost always players who have played several years of Test cricket and are not sure of their places in the Test eleven. A recent example of retirement from Tests is Shoaib Malik who did so after almost two decades of cricket and making a comeback to the Test team after six years. ', u'And if Morne Morkel has hinted he will back out of Test cricket he would have been out of Tests anyway because of fitness. Likewise Alex Hales and Adil Rashid, who recently signed up only for white ball cricket were not regulars in the England Test team.', u'Lastly, it has to be said that eventual loyalty comes from nationalism. And T20 cricket offers that in bits and pieces. Rest of the time the players are playing for teams that their fellow citizens don\u2019t identify with. That doesn\u2019t lead to a following. In club football you don\u2019t see players changing colleagues as you do cricketers when they play in three to four leagues per year. So there is a clear loyalty built over a 100 years per club and loyalty to players and team following. In cricket you see colleagues in one league becoming opponents a few days later in another. That doesn\u2019t lead to loyalty and following.', u'For the moment this is a circus where cricketers are skillful exponents like trapeze artists and jugglers. People will eventually get bored with that. Passionate loyalties are built around national sides. And Test cricket is built on that alone. When the plot thickens it\u2019s the cat among the pigeons and no lions roar can drown the interest, the technique and the following. Thew difference is as clear as red and white.'], 'link': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1393207/comment-why-testing-times-shall-prevail-in-cricket', 'heading': u'Comment: Why testing times shall prevail in cricket'}

{'date': u' ', 'text': [u'For as long as I can remember, expressing myself on the internet came easily to me. Scratching up Cybernet cards and using all my 30 minutes of \u2018internet time\u2019 on Blogspot, was my favourite part of the day as a teenager. It was exciting to be writing on the internet only to find that what seemed to be mundane parts of my very average life, were stories that people in other parts of the world looked forward to reading. Fast forward 16 years and in a satisfying, self-fulfilling prophecy, the internet became my full-time job.', u'At first, it sounded dreadful when the older generation wanted to know my job description. And it drew a lot of awkward stares when my complex explanation of what ', u' is (an online community and a blog) was translated as: ', u' Then it got better. ', u'The Millennials though, specifically the urban women in Pakistan, recognise the platform and many find it to be a place of solace, new friendships and advice (with a dash of arguments). When I first started ', u' four years ago, the objective was only to share my thoughts with a small community of women and have them do the same. But as word got around, the conversations broadened and the audience grew. It was remarkable to see the extent to which Pakistani women needed a place where they could vent their feelings, even if anonymously. And it was so thrilling to find hidden talents among the many members who sought support, help and motivation from one another. It was when I started receiving calls from brands and TV channels that I realised what I had created. ', u'Now, because I reside in Jeddah (due to my husband\u2019s job) and most of my work is based in Pakistan, I have to travel almost every alternate month to Karachi to fulfil my commitments. In between travelling and my personal life, I would say being me is extremely hectic! Yet, surprisingly, I relish every minute of it. I guess that happens when you enjoy what you do. Touch wood. ', u'Moving on to a day in my life. As much as I would like to say that it starts with a cup of lemon water and cathartic yoga, it is actually quite the opposite. I wake up with my daughter talking next to my face (much earlier than I would prefer). I then head first to the kitchen to drown my lethargy in a cup of vanilla latt\xe9. In between breakfast rituals and bathroom turns, I like to check my emails for meetings/commitments during the day, and approve pending posts on the ', u' Facebook group. ', u'In Karachi, I have converted the guest room at my parents\u2019 house into my office and that is where I work from when I am in town. In the earlier part of my day, I like to wrap up work that I need to get done online after which, I generally head out for meetings. ', u'If I have no meetings, I almost always have other commitments \u2013 events, shoots or editing work. Yet, on some days, I like to imagine none of these exist and I go for a spontaneous lunch date with a friend. I like to do this particularly when I have a truckload of work, because procrastination gives me an adrenaline rush. There, I said it. ', u'Until a few months ago, I had let work take over my life. It\u2019s not easy moderating a group of 40,000 women \u2013 since all of us have strong opinions and the right to voice them. On top of that, the ', u' blog which publishes a new story every other day, takes up a fair amount of time even though I have my brilliant sub-editor to assist me every step of the way. The ', u' community also hosts small events several times a year. We keep them thematic and the idea is to give women living in the same city an opportunity to meet each other, socialise, network, as well as get a chance to let their hair down. The events have always been a success and tickets run out in minutes when registration opens. Other than that, I have also re-launched my own blog \u2013 ', u' \u2013 a few months ago, in order to share snippets of my own life. ', u'With so much happening, I decided at the end of last year to cut back on my 14 to 15 hour work day and devote more time to myself and to my family because it is very easy to turn into a workaholic without realising it. And since a large amount of my day is consumed in talking to people and directing them towards some sort of professional help \u2013 whether psychological, legal or financial \u2013 it can get emotionally draining for me as well.', u'Overall, these are exciting times. Women have stepped up their game in the past year \u2013 globally. We may not have shattered patriarchy, but our echoes have definitely bounced off all the right corners. It\u2019s been an honour to have given women in Pakistan the opportunity to express themselves and so humbling to know that outing their thoughts on the platform was only because of the sense of security that came with it. And I love the fact that this platform inspired the start of many others and we have multiple other Pakistani women-oriented groups now operating via Facebook, which give women a space and the freedom to express themselves. For a society like ours, where women still go through multiple dilemmas (that should have been left behind in the 19th century), these safe spaces have a very significant impact. ', u'On a similar note, to have witnessed firsthand the evolution of digital media in Pakistan has been an exhilarating experience. It\u2019s absolutely incredible to see that consumers now want to see real people with real lives and how they associate with a specific product. It\u2019s believable. It\u2019s relatable. And it definitely empowers consumers to ask for firsthand information from someone they trust. It also places a lot more responsibility on our shoulders as influencers and that we only take on endorsements and campaigns that we truly believe in. And personally, I would pick the people who believe in me over every other thing, any day.'], 'link': 'https://aurora.dawn.com/news/1142893/soul-space', 'heading': u'\n'}

All aspects of her life have been alluded to in acknowledgement of her great services to society. She made Pakistan proud.', u'But there was one aspect in her tale of heroism and valour that has entirely escaped elaboration. And those that have mentioned it, have done so fleetingly. Yet that is the side on which the \u2018Jahangir\u2019 of \u2018Asma Jahangir\u2019 lived. ', u'In our society the role of a woman as a domesticated home-bound mother, is chiselled in the stone of tradition and custom. It can only be an exceptional mother-in-law who will not complain to her son about his activist wife. Most will make the point unceasingly. The grievance is that in her activism the wife is ignoring the complainant\u2019s grand\xadchildren. Even if the husband continues to stand by her, his resolve will be tested by pestering parents. ', u'The parents of Mian Tahir Jahangir, Asma\u2019s husband, were of a different mould. And he, too: unique in his attitude, acceptance, solidarity and support. ', u'They could have perceived her as a bull in the Fazl-e-Ahmed china shop. But they did not.', u'Mian Fazl-e-Ahmed and his wife, Begum Tahira, both belonged to conservative business families who normally shun politics of any variety. ', u'Mian Fazl\u2019s preoccupations were industry and philanthropy, presiding over one of the largest industrial groups in the country, the Premier Group with its flagship, the Premier Textile Mills Lyallpur. But even the time he spent at the Mills, was mainly consumed by his first passion in life: the eradication of tuberculosis from Pakistan. ', u'Then there was the administration of the Mian Mohammad Trust Hospital named after his late father. This 200-bed hospital thrives to this day in the heart of Faisalabad where land is valued as if it were paved with gold. Yet the family, and now Tahir, continue to run it exclusively as a charity hospital with a better environment and services than any other hospital in Punjab. A much-needed nursing institute has been added to it by Tahir.', u'Tahir\u2019s family thus lived in a quiet, peaceful and idyllic haven of their own. Cocooned in luxury, they stepped out only to engage in voluntary and non-profit public service. They had a large circle of friends in Lyallpur and Lahore, none of them politically minded. Agitation was not a word in their dictionaries.', u'Tahir too, had led a life of luxury. He had had a swimming pool, horse stables and fleets of cars in his father\u2019s homes in Lyallpur and Lahore since his childhood. He was an alumni of Aitchison College and Cambridge University. From school to completion of our Master\u2019s degrees at Cambridge, (the Tripos), Tahir and I were classmates and friends. But Tahir throughout was the topper: winning the gold medal for the best academic in school in our final year at Aitchison.', u'Tahir (TJ to friends) was a prince and had been brought up like one. Even when Cambridge closed for as little as a few days, TJ would fly home or to an exotic holiday venue as we, the plebs, slogged on in our digs in a deserted university town. Back in Cambridge, Tahir drove around in an MGB Convertible. In winters he spent time in Switzerland\u2019s ski resorts rubbing shoulders with the world\u2019s rich and famous. His wardrobe was all from Cambridge\u2019s most expensive shop, Arthur Shepherd. He spent sunny days punting on the Cam, the scenic river that gave its name to the town, or speeding around in the MGB, hood down, and blonde hair flying from the passenger seat. ', u'Since he usually ate at the most expensive restaurants, and in elite company, he was witness to the first meeting between Rajiv Gandhi and his future wife, Sonia, as they sat on different tables in The Varsity eatery and Rajiv asked a waiter to deliver a bottle of wine to her as a token of his admiration. The rest is history. ', u'Then in the quiet serenity of the Fazl-e-Ahmed clan entered the whirlwind! TJ married Asma. ', u'Back in Pakistan and focusing primarily on running a family ghee mill in Lahore, the prince married a woman who would always live precariously and on the edge. But he never crossed her path. The entire Fazl-e-Ahmed family, including Tahir\u2019s sister Nageen and her husband Ayaz (Jajji), remained, much against their grain, highly supportive. They sought to impose no constraints upon Asma. She had married into a law-fearing business family and brought with her the vigour and pugilistic character of her father, Malik Ghulam Jilani, a political jail bird. They could have perceived her as a bull in the Fazl-e-Ahmed china shop. But they did not.', u'Each member of the Mian Fazl clan was devoted to Asma\u2019s endeavours. Even when she was campaigning for bonded labour, TJ would be explaining to his industrialist friends, business magnates and the elite, how necessary that campaign was. TJ has a sharp sense of humour and a close circle of friends who took time understanding or appreciating Asma\u2019s great potential. But he continued to stand by her like a rock. His parents also bore the constant jeopardy of unannounced police raids with unmatched equanimity, never insisting that Asma give up and \u2018domesticate\u2019 herself. ', u'Asma\u2019s own children grew up in a world of extreme tension and trepidation not knowing when, and for what, their mother would be attacked or taken to prison. But Munizae, Sulema and Jilani Jahangir also stood steadfast by their mother like rocks on which she could anchor her life. And yet they resolutely made space for themselves. At a young age Munizae is a very competent and nationally acknowledged television anchor. Sulema, an accomplished lawyer has decided to move back to Pakistan to fill the place left vacant by Asma in her law firm, the AGHS. And Jilani Jahangir now runs his father\u2019s business of textiles, allowing respite to TJ to pursue his passion for hiking, mountaineering and photography. ', u'Would Asma have been \u2018Asma\u2019 had her in-laws, husband and children been narrow-minded pestering bigots and not as enlightened and broad-minded as they in fact were?

{'date': u' March 05, 2018', 'text': [u'\t\t\t\n', u'BEIJING: President Xi Jinping is poised to make a historic power grab as China\u2019s legislators gather from Monday to approve changes that will let him rule indefinitely and undo decades of efforts to prevent a return to crushing dictatorship.', u'This year\u2019s gathering of the ceremonial National People\u2019s Congress has been overshadowed by Xi\u2019s surprise move announced just a week ago to end constitutional two-term limits on the presidency. The changes would allow Xi, already China\u2019s most powerful leader in decades, to extend his rule over the world\u2019s second largest economy possibly for life.', u'\u201cThis is a critical moment in China\u2019s history,\u201d said Cheng Li, an expert on elite China politics at the Brookings Institution in Washington.', u'The move is widely seen as the culmination of the 64-year-old Xi\u2019s efforts since being appointed leader of the ruling Communist Party in 2012 to concentrate power in his own hands and defy norms of collective leadership established over the past two decades. Xi has appointed himself to head bodies that oversee national security, finance, economic reform and other major initiatives, effectively sidelining the party\u2019s No 2 figure, Premier Li Keqiang.', u'Once passed, the constitutional amendment would upend a system enacted by former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in 1982 to prevent a return to the bloody excesses of a lifelong dictatorship typified by Mao Zedong\u2019s chaotic 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution.', u'\u201cDeng Xiaoping\u2019s abolishment of lifetime tenure for the leadership and more institutionalised transitions in power are very much in question,\u201d Li said.', u'Passage of the proposed constitutional amendment by the congress\u2019 nearly 3,000 handpicked delegates is all but certain. But observers will be looking to see how many delegates abstain from voting as an indication of the reservations the move has encountered even within the political establishment.', u'On Sunday, Zhang Yesui, the legislature\u2019s spokesman, told reporters the move is only aimed at bringing the office of the president in line with Xi\u2019s other positions atop the party and the Central Military Commission, which do not impose term limits.', u'\u201cIt is conducive to upholding the authority of the Central Committee of the party with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core and also to unified leadership,\u201d Zhang said.', u'Chinese authorities have tightly controlled discussion about the move, scrubbing social media of critical and satirical comments. State media have been largely muted about the topic, but the official People\u2019s Daily sought to reassure the public by saying in a commentary that the move did not signal a return to lifelong rule.', u'\u201cThis amendment does not mean changes in the system of retirement for party and state leaders and also does not imply that leaders will have lifetime tenure,\u201d the party\u2019s mouthpiece said on Thursday.', u'Still, a number of prominent Chinese figures have publicly protested the move, despite the risk of official retaliation.', u'Li Datong, a former editor for the state-run China Youth Daily, wrote that lifting term limits would \u201csow the seeds of chaos\u201d and urged Beijing\u2019s lawmakers to exercise their power by rejecting the amendment. ', u'Wang Ying, a businesswoman who has advocated government reforms, called the proposal \u201can outright betrayal\u201d.', u'Many expressed shock and disbelief at what they perceived to be a return to the Mao era, and the massive upheaval, violence and chaos of the Cultural Revolution 50 years ago that has barely faded from memory.', u'Already, the blanket and entirely positive coverage of Xi in official propaganda has drawn comparisons of a cult of personality to rival Mao\u2019s.', u'State network China Central Television broadcasts near-daily segments featuring anyone from factory workers and farmers to space engineers and soldiers applauding for Xi in uniform enthusiasm for several minutes. His airbrushed, blemish- and nearly-wrinkle-free face often dominates the front pages of state newspapers.', u'But some analysts note there are a number of key differences between Xi and communist China\u2019s revolutionary founders that mean any major policy failure could obstruct Xi\u2019s ambitions.', u'\u201cXi Jinping is not loved and admired the way that Deng Xiaoping was. Xi Jinping is feared within the party,\u201d said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at London\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies.', u'Xi has also waged expansive anti-corruption crackdown that some perceive as at least in part a purge of his rivals. This has surely won him many enemies, making the prospect of ceding power potentially risky.', u'Tsang said the party would follow Xi as long as things went well but that any serious economic misstep over the next five years would threaten Xi\u2019s ability to extend his rule.', u'\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a foregone conclusion that he will have a third term,\u201d Tsang said.', u'Xi\u2019s power grab will be seriously tested by how he tackles grave challenges at home and abroad.', u'Chief among them is slowing growth in the state-dominated economy that is forecast to fall further as regulators try to get rising debt in check by tightening controls to cool booms in bank lending and real estate sales.', u'Abroad, China is faced with the task of maintaining stability and avoiding the outbreak of war on the neighbouring Korean peninsula, while also managing escalating frictions with the US that threaten to evolve into a trade war.', u'Some observers say extending Xi\u2019s rule gives him greater authority to address such challenges and carry out his vision of fighting corruption, eliminating poverty and transforming China into a modern leading nation by midcentury. The argument goes that lower-level officials tasked with carrying out needed changes won\u2019t be able to assume they can do the bare minimum and wait for his term to end.', u'Others say the risk of policy missteps is multiplied because Xi has made it politically risky for people to disagree with him and challenge his unbridled power.', u'The decision to scrap term limits was a case in point, Tsang said, noting that party leaders must have foreseen that such a move was going to be deeply unpopular, yet seemed unable or unwilling to steer Xi away from it.', u'\u201cWhat it does reveal is Xi Jinping is creating and deepening a moral hazard that now people will not want to say anything to contradict him, not only in public but even in private,\u201d Tsang said.', u'\u201cIf this is the kind if pattern of policymaking, moving forward, the risk of bad decisions being made because they were not properly debated before they were made is getting higher and higher,\u201d he added.', u'What has been particularly alarming to many about the proposed removal of term limits was not only the move itself but seeming hastiness with which it was introduced. The Chinese public has grown accustomed to some measure of public debate about new laws or changes to existing laws. Some laws go through three or even four readings, but not in this case, observers pointed out.', u'\u201cWhen it comes to the revision of the constitution, how could it be that there is not a significant public commenting process, that there is not a more deliberative review process?\u201d said Dali Yang, a China expert at the University of Chicago. \u201cThat\u2019s truly a remarkable contrast.\u201d ', u'Few experts expected China to adopt a Western-style, freewheeling democracy. But a return to one-man rule diminishes the likelihood that China\u2019s one-party system could move as some had hoped toward governing with greater accountability through the establishment of rules-based, impartial institutions.', u'This shows \u201cthe one-party system cannot be fully institutionalised. They operate as secret societies; nothing is public,\u201d said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, an expert on Chinese politics at Hong Kong Baptist University. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of a \u2018Godfather\u2019 and he will remain the Godfather until the next one comes along.\u201d\u2014AP'], 'link': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1393310/china-sets-stage-for-xis-historic-grab-to-rule-indefinitely', 'heading': u'China sets stage for Xi\u2019s historic grab to rule indefinitely'}

{'date': u' March 05, 2018', 'text': [u'\t\t\t\n', u'AS the world is embroiled in multiple crises from the Korean peninsula to Syria, Britain is still caught up in the self-created mess triggered by its decision to leave the European Union through an ill-judged referendum in July 2016. Anybody who listened to Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s speech on BBC World last Friday would have noticed the lack of detail about the \u201chard choices\u201d that she said lay ahead.', u'May has to perform a difficult balancing act in trying to placate the \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d Brexiteers in her party. And to compound her problems, there is also a group of Tories who voted Remain in the referendum. Getting a good Brexit deal with all these divergent forces pulling in different directions would have tested a strong, popular leader. Unfortunately, May is neither. Greatly weakened by her decision to call a snap election last summer that saw the Conservative Party lose its slim parliamentary majority, she is only in power because party grandees would rather have her take the blame for a bad Brexit deal.', u'Outsiders are still puzzling over why the British have taken such an obviously disastrous decision. After all, being in the EU has produced many decades of unprecedented prosperity. From the strikes and power cuts of the \u201870s to the high living standards today, Britain has done very well through its membership in the EU. But just as there have been winners, there are losers who made their resentment plain by voting Brexit. In an incisive article, Ian Black spelled out in The Guardian why so many voted to leave the EU.', u'Between 1979 and 1986, jobs in manufacturing shrank from seven million to 5.1m as factories, mostly in the north, were gutted. Although this trend began earlier, Margaret Thatcher is blamed for her neglect of manufacturing, and her focus on the financial sector. This imbalance saw opportunities and prosperity shift to the south. Of all the jobs lost, 94 per cent were in the north. Skills were lost and traditions ended. For many, part of what it meant to be British disappeared.', u'Secondly, according to Black, large-scale immigration in the \u201860s and \u201870s caused huge resentment. \u201cNobody asked us\u201d was a common refrain. But by 2004, anti-immigrant feelings had mostly died down. That was the year Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government decided to allow workers from east and central Europe whose countries had recently joined the EU to enter Britain. It was expected that between 5,000 and 13,000 would take up the offer. In the event, 129,000 flooded into the UK in the first year.', u'There are now well over half a million Polish workers and their families alone. The total number of EU workers in the UK is now 2.3m. These immigrants have placed a huge strain on medical and educational services as well as housing. The job market for Brits has become tighter as wages have fallen or remained stagnant due to the presence of outsiders willing to work for less. Not unnaturally, these factors have reignited anti-immigrant sentiments that were expressed in the 2016 Brexit referendum.', u'Less quantifiable factors include what Black calls \u2018cultural dementia\u2019. This is a harking back to a mythical past that conservatives want to resurrect. In the United States, for example, the \u201850s and \u201860s are seen as a golden era when the middle class expanded rapidly, good manufacturing jobs allowed millions to have their own houses in suburbia, and unemployment was low. Never mind that blacks were openly discriminated against, and many were denied entry into many restaurants across the country. This is the period Trump so successfully evoked in his presidential run.', u'In the UK, nostalgia for Empire is visible in the popularity of TV serials and movies about the Raj. By taking Britain out of the EU, conservatives hope to strike trade deals with its ex-colonies, imagining that they would flock to oblige their ex-colonial masters. But they might find that these days, money talks while bull--- walks. And countries like China still remember how it was forced to allow British opium traders to force the drug into their country at bayonet point. Victory in the Second World War is another triumphalist moment that is regularly invoked as proof of British prowess.', u'Then there is the delusion of English exceptionalism. This is a conviction that Britain deserves to sit at the top table, along with more powerful countries. This has resulted in the country spending far more than it can afford on aircraft carriers and Trident nuclear submarines. Many British conservatives are convinced that their country is capable of punching above its weight.', u'Black blames the \u201cplaying fields of Eton\u201d for much of the Brexit mess. David Cameron, the architect and prime mover of the referendum, is first in line for having first promised the vote in 2009, and then delivering on it as he caved in to pressure from the right wing of his party. Boris Johnson is another Eton alumnus who played a key role in securing a Brexit majority with his hyperbole and outright lies. A cartoonish figure, his ambition outruns his abilities. Another caricature from Eton is Jacob Rees-Mogg whose main claim to fame are his old-fashioned suits and clipped accent. Oddly, he is being viewed as a possible successor to Theresa May.', u'Recently, John Major, Maggie Thatcher\u2019s successor after she was ejected by her own party, weighed in with this warning: \u201cThe government\u2019s disregard for economic and diplomatic realities have set the country on a trajectory towards calamity.\u201d Predictably, he was castigated by Tory MPs as \u201can embittered hypocrite, propagandist and traitor\u201d.', u'This divisive debate over Brexit is likely to continue until the day Britain leaves the EU, and well beyond.'], 'link': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1393309/view-from-abroad-the-brexit-quandary', 'heading': u'View From Abroad: The Brexit quandary'}

And he was spot on. She is a talented vocalist.", u'\u2018He was consistent in producing impressive work for 50 years\u2019', u'Poet Iftikhar Arif, who on the occasion spoke via phone from Islamabad, said after the likes of Aziz Hamid Madani and Mehshar Badayuni, Rasa was the most notable representative of the classical traditions of ghazal.', u'With the passage of time, as one grows old, a poet\u2019s creations also suffer. However, this was not the case with Rasa. He was consistent in producing impressive work for 50 years. One of the late poet\u2019s couplets became very popular in the 1960s. It was:', u'*Hum ne socha tha is ajnabi shehr mein, zindagi chaltey phirtey guzar jaey gi', u'Ye magar kia khabar thi ta\u2019aqub mein hain aik nadeeda zanjeer-i-hamsaigi', u'[I had thought that in this unfamiliar city life would go on like it usually does', u'Little did I know I was being followed by a chain of unseen neighbourly ties]*', u'Mr Iftikhar said many poets touched the topic of Zanjeer-e-Hamsaigi at the time, but Rasa kept writing on the subject. Sometimes what happened was that the published works of poets diminished their worth a bit; again, that did not happen with Rasa. Another thing that Arif mentioned was that Rasa sahib used classical diction with a modern sensibility.', u'Prof Sahar Ansari recalled the time when a friend in London told him about how two couplets were being discussed in the Urdu circles in England. One was by Baqar Naqvi and the other by Rasa Chughtai. So, Rasa sahib\u2019s name had travelled overseas before he himself could. This meant that what had a far-reaching effect was a creative person\u2019s work.', u'Prof Ansari said Rasa sahib was one of those poets who frequented Karachi\u2019s cafes where writers usually congregated in the past. The late poet wrote about human emotions and psychology [', u']. The professor also mentioned that recently an Indian friend on Facebook inquired him about one of Rasa sahib\u2019s verses:', u'Aadmi kis kamaal ka ho ga', u'Jis ne tasveer se nikala mujhe', u'[He must be a exceptional man', u'Who pulled me out of the picture]', u'Poet Sarwer Jawaid said he had known the late poet since the 1960s when his presence was a must at mushairas. He pointed out that there were poets who became poets after acquiring certain social statuses in society but Rasa acquired a status because of his poetry.', u'Rasa sahib\u2019s daughter Hasanat Ayesha said the poet became Rasa Chughtai after sacrificing Mirza Muhtashim Baig (his real name).', u'Arts Council\u2019s president Ahmed Shah expressed his dissatisfaction over the way the media reported Rasa sahib\u2019s death and the fact that people did not turn up at events organised in honour of Urdu poets.', u'Khwaja Razi Haider, Afsar Imran, Rehana Roohi, Anwar Ansari, A.

', u'On Feb 27, however, Rawal made a bit of a slip. He accidentally tweeted a google document titled: Trend Alert: #Jhoothicongress, an internal document circulated by the BJP\u2019s media cell containing a list of tweets in English and Hindi attacking the Congress party for its alleged incompetence, corruption and duplicity on a range of issues. ', u'These were meant to be tweeted in unison by the BJP\u2019s cell, and while Rawal realised his gaffe and quickly deleted the tweet, the tweetstorm began on schedule and, sure enough, #Jhoothicongress was soon trending \u2014 thanks to a mere 473 users posting 489 tweets (and of course the ensuing retweets) out of a total user base that numbers in the millions. From here, the cascade effect took place, as more and more latched on to the now prominent hashtag. ', u'Thus, a small bunch of dedicated keyboard grabbers can create the illusion of mass support and raise their cause to the level where it attracts millions of eyeballs.', u'Pakistani social media is swamped with \u2018social media cells\u2019.', u'Pakistani social media is also swamped with the \u2018social media cells\u2019 of political parties and pressure groups that follow the same format. Some employ \u2018bots\u2019: automated accounts that appear to be of real people but in fact tweet what they are programmed to. Thus is public opinion moulded, and governments across the world have taken note. ', u'It was the Arab Spring, where protesters turned to social media (the only outlet free of government control) to coordinate their actions and spread their narrative, that forced governments to ask: how do we use this to our advantage and to counter the narrative of our opponents?', u'Small wonder then, that the NGO Freedom House reports that over 30 countries employ active \u2018cyber troops\u2019 to disseminate propaganda on social media and shout down opponents and critics. In 2013, Israel launched a programme to create \u2018covert units\u2019 of students in seven Israeli universities who would engage in \u2018online public diplomacy\u2019. Known as hasbara, this effectively translates into spreading Israeli propaganda online and shouting down opponents. Indeed, curbing domestic dissent through social media is now largely the global focus. ', u'Take Russia, where the Internet Research Agency and Nashi are just two organisations known to train and pay trolls to attack Putin\u2019s domestic and foreign enemies. There are daily targets and agendas, with lists of \u2018enemies\u2019 being circulated, who are then subjected to vicious and well-coordinated attacks by the many accounts controlled by these operatives who usually work out of so-called \u2018troll factories\u2019 and are even given English lessons to be able to more effectively play their roles. One estimate is that they account for 45 per cent of total twitter activity in Russia.', u'A nine-country study by Oxford University notes that Azerbaijan hosts over 50 pro-government \u2018troll-training centres\u2019 whose mandate is to harass and abuse opposition politicians and journalists deemed not \u2018patriotic\u2019 enough, drowning them out in a deluge of abuse. Any questions about human rights abuses are quickly countered with \u2018whataboutism\u2019 and comparisons with arch-enemy Armenia.', u'Then there\u2019s China, where a report by Harvard University estimates \u201cthat the government fabricates and posts about 448 million social media comments a year\u201d. In a contrast from the Russian and Azerbaijani tactics, Chinese cyber warriors don\u2019t typically troll dissidents or spread disinformation but instead aim to distract social media users during key moments.', u'Democratic elections have proven quite vulnerable to such tactics, and there are many who attempt to use them. In 2013, South Korea\u2019s spy agency admitted to sending out over a million tweets to support conservative presidential candidate Park Geun-hye and smear her opponents for being pro-North Korea.

{'date': None, 'text': [u'My journey into advertising began in the late 50s. I studied for my Secondary Board examinations at NJV High School and later graduated in drawing from the Government of Sind\u2019s Department of Education in 1951. In 1953, after completing my high school examination, I joined S.M. Arts College. Then I joined Aga Khan Higher Secondary School for two years, teaching drawing and maths.', u'In 1956, on my uncle\u2019s recommendation, I joined Manhattan Advertising as a commercial artist. My father was a poet and playwright whose pen name was Suman, and he encouraged me to pursue my interest in the fine arts and painting. As a result, I began my career as an artist and subsequently moved to the commercial arts. Painting and drawing fascinated me, and continue to do so. At the time, advertising was one of the few professions that were ideal for creative people.', u'I worked at several local and multinational advertising agencies until 1960, and then left for London and joined W.S. Crawford, one of the leading advertising agencies of the time. I joined their Art Department, and one of the brands that I worked on was PIA. While I was there, I started taking evening classes at the Central School of Arts and studied art and advertising. When Crawford decided to open a branch office in Karachi in 1962, I was transferred there as an art director; our other major clients included ICI and Ferozsons.', u'In 1963, PIA moved to another multinational ad agency. Seeing the writing on the wall, I decided to start my own advertising firm, Asiatic Advertising, in partnership with the late Sultan Ghulamani. In 1966, another friend, Shaukat Fancy, left his father\u2019s business and joined us. In 1969, Ghulamani left and in 1970, Ghayasuddin Sheikh joined as a Finance Director and Framroze H. Punthakey left JWT and joined us as a Client Service Director.  Fancy left Asiatic in 1971, and the remaining three musketeers began to diligently build an ethical and respected advertising business.', u'Advertising in those days was different in many ways, yet in some ways similar. An average day included meetings with clients, brainstorming sessions and of course, late nights \u2013 and plenty of them (that has definitely not changed). An artist by inclination and training, I occasionally took refuge in painting to relieve me from the stress of working late hours.', u'In fact, I spent so much time at the office that my wife told my sons, Karim and Amin, to avoid advertising, and that if they did choose it as a profession, they should abandon the notion of getting married, since it was not possible to pursue a career in advertising and remain married. However, Karim proved her wrong by managing a highly successful career in advertising while staying married. Amin tried to conform to his mother\u2019s aspirations by taking up the sciences to become a doctor. However, after a few months, he too decided that his heart was not in it; the lure of marketing was too strong for him to resist. Clearly, my passion for, and commitment to, my work was contagious as Karim and Amin were strongly drawn to advertising and marketing from an early age, despite persistent efforts by their mother to dissuade them.', u'Many hours of our days were spent conducting market research, and I think that the people who worked in advertising then \u2013 before matters became more streamlined \u2013 really knew their consumers inside out. I say this because at that time, agencies would receive a 15% commission on media placements; we would usually use the money to focus on the capacity-building of our employees and research, which would provide us with consumer insights to help design our campaigns.', u'Singer once approached me about advertising their latest computerised machines that made sweaters. I suggested market research to find out about the target customers before proceeding. We sent our team to the market and discovered that retailers found it convenient to sell the traditional sewing machines and were not interested in selling the computerised machines. The prices of these units were also steep, so we recommended that instead of an ad campaign, they should position their product at the middle-class entrepreneur and make it available in installments. They agreed, and the machines sold. We didn\u2019t charge a penny for the research because we believed it was our responsibility to be honest with our client. Something else that took up a major part of our day was actual drawing; even the presentations we did for our clients were hand-drawn \u2013 unlike today, where we have Photoshop and PowerPoint to make things easier. ', u'As print was the dominant medium for advertising, copy was extremely important. With limited visuals and that too in black-and-white, the emphasis was on communicating a message customers could relate to and never forget. That is the reason we can still remember some of the old jingles, press ads and slogans so well. ', u'I remember Anwar Mooraj (who was a brilliant copywriter) and I going to Sandspit to brainstorm there. In my opinion, one of the best campaigns I did was for Prince Glass. They introduced hanging ceiling light shades, and their budget was only enough for one press ad. While brainstorming, I pointed my hand at the ceiling and made a downward motion to show that the ceiling is common in every house and suddenly, Anwar said he got an idea: \u201cBeauty descends from the ceiling.\u201d The client loved it, and we released the ad.', u'Our other clients included Beecham, Habib Insurance, Jet, Johnson & Johnson, KLM, Singer and Tibet; sadly, many of these brands are no longer in Pakistan. Such was our success that in 1989, we entered the international arena and became associates of J. Walter Thompson Worldwide, and in the process, gained brands such as Kodak, Lipton, Lux, and Shell. In 2001, JWT acquired Asiatic. Although they bought 100% of the business, they requested us to stay and continue to run the it. I became Chairman and Karim became the youngest president of a JWT office worldwide. Asiatic, which began with five staff members in 1963, had 150 of the best and brightest ad men and women in Pakistan by the time it was acquired by JWT.', u'Along this journey, what has remained constant is a belief that society, and not nature, turns us into handicapped individuals. We gave a few handicapped individuals a chance to prove themselves in the art studio. We trained four hearing-and speech-impaired people, and a physically-handicapped person. Today, two of these four artists are settled in the US and doing exceptionally well. The other two are still working with the company. In 1976, when Asiatic opened, we had a deaf-and-dumb art director, who was a graduate of NCA Lahore. ', u'In many ways, these are like the handicaps that many ad men and women impose on themselves these days when building brands, strategies and creative routes. Although times change, people\u2019s preferences vary and brands will come and go, the basic idea of appealing to people\u2019s inner nature will always be the cornerstone of good advertising; the need to go farther, feel better, eat healthier and get more done will always be a driving force. If we can effectively communicate these, and other fundamental concerns, advertising will remain immortal.', u'Presently I am the Chairman and Director of Asiatic Public Relations. My honourary work includes being a founder member of The Patients\u2019 Behbud Society at AKUH, a board member of the National Academy of Performing Arts and a trustee of the Foundation of Museum of Modern Art. Although my days of advertising are behind me, I can safely say that I miss them very much.', u'\n'], 'link': 'https://aurora.dawn.com/news/1142841/journey-of-an-ad-man', 'heading': u'A casserole of chaos and loud laughter'}

{'date': u' March 05, 2018', 'text': [u'It was not unexpected that the bigots Asma Jahangir had fought against throughout her life would try to sully her legacy in death; nonetheless there was an unusual ferocity to the manner in which Pakistani right-wingers lined up to attack her funeral itself. ', u'Anchors like Orya Maqbool Jan thundered from their electronic media pulpits about how the mixed-gender gathering was an affront to Islam, right-wing social media pages of all stripes denounced the mourners as having warred against God Himself, and prominent clerics of various sects lined up to offer fatwas declaring her funeral prayers null and void. ', u'The response of most liberals and progressives to such vitriol was a predominantly defensive one. Many tried to respond earnestly to the accusations of anti-religiousness, pointing out that the admissibility of mixed-gender funerals was a contested issue, that there was no reference to its impermissibility in religion and that numerous precedents exist in Islamic history of women attending funeral prayers and so forth.', u' ', u'One can understand such responses; there is much of value in using scriptural reasoning from within the Islamic tradition to push back against the idea that the regressive ideals of the clergy and political Islamists represent the totality of the Islamic faith. ', u'Yet far too often, such defences take the right-wing critique at face value and fail to unmask the dubious interests hidden underneath the attacks.', u'In this case, the right was belying its tenuous claims to gender justice by revealing itself as the perpetual vanguard of patriarchy that it is. ', u'Through its full-throated defence of gender segregation, it exposed itself as the defender of a system designed to keep women hidden, excluded and firmly subordinated to men.', u'Gender segregation is taken to be an established fact of life in Pakistan. Couched in the religio-cultural language of ', u', it is practised in every region and ethnic group, in cities, towns and rural areas, in offices and weddings, and from traditional settings to even more relatively open spaces. ', u'The terms and severity of enforcement can vary, but its ideological basis and social practise remains largely unchallenged at a social level, as evidenced by the sheer absence of women in public spaces in any average town in the country.', u'The  right \u2013 and the millions who have imbibed its ideology - like to pretend that the creation of separate spheres for men and women guards against the \u2018moral corruption\u2019 that is so pervasive in the \u2018decadent West\u2019. ', u'The right frames segregation as relating to the \u2018natural\u2019 roles of men and women, as though it were an equal separation into social spheres tailored to men and women\u2019s naturally distinct abilities and needs.', u'This characterisation of segregation is manifestly untrue. In a rigidly patriarchal social context where the disparities between the genders are so vast in every field of life, segregation amounts to nothing less than a means to exclude women from the public sphere and prevent them from wielding social, economic and political power. ', u'In Pakistan\u2019s context, it forms a central fulcrum of the patriarchal system that inhibits women\u2019s progress in all walks of life by limiting their social roles to the private sphere.', u'While the more flagrant forms of violence \u2013 such as honour killings \u2013 that segregationist discourse engenders are better recognised, less is acknowledged about the more subtle, systemic ways in which it excludes women.', u' ', u'Take the case of education. Pakistan\u2019s entire public education system is structured to meet the demands of ', u', with separate schools for boys and girls from primary to high school level. In theory, this could simply mean boys and girls receiving an equal education separately. ', u'Yet the reality is that segregated education is far from equally provisioned \u2013 boys\u2019 schools and colleges in the public sector ', u" (with roughly 3 boys' schools for every 2 girls' schools), a ratio that gets worse at higher levels of schooling. ", u'It is no surprise therefore, that girls drop out at higher rates than boys given that they have successively fewer opportunities as they grow older, with some districts even lacking a single high school for thousands of girl students. ', u'In many cases, the lack of girls\u2019 schools could be corrected very simply, by opening existing schools in a region to both genders; but beyond some such instances at primary level, segregationist ideology ensures that working class girls are prevented from continuing their education after they reach adolescence. ', u'Often, when progressive teachers attempt to circumvent segregationist norms to admit female students in boys\u2019 high schools and colleges, they are met with fierce opposition from right-wing colleagues who deem co-education \u2018un-Islamic\u2019.', u'Segregation\u2019s insidious effects extend beyond education into other spheres of life. The history of Pakistan\u2019s approach to women\u2019s health is also one where the health system has been structured to cater to segregationist dictates. ', u'Multiple studies have documented how norms of ', u' severely limit rural and working class women\u2019s ability to access healthcare, particularly reproductive health. ', u' ', u'Yet instead of challenging such bizarre cultural values that actively threaten women\u2019s lives, the state has always chosen to reinforce and reify them.', u'Pakistan spends billions to circumvent the constraints of ', u' in health care provision; the government recruits tens of thousands of mobile female health workers whose sole purpose is to cater to women\u2019s health needs within their homes to avoid offending the sensibilities of patriarchs unwilling to let \u2018their\u2019 women come into contact with unrelated men. ', u'Needless to say, such programmes, which demand resources, skills and capacities in short supply in the country, and which are further limited by patriarchal constraints on female health workers, often fall short in adequately meeting women\u2019s health needs.', u'Segregationist tendencies also bear significant responsibility for Pakistan\u2019s shockingly high maternal and infant mortality rates. Beyond their resistance to contraception, men often resist facility births, viewing home births as the only \u2018honourable\u2019 way for mothers to give birth, regardless of the consequences for the mother and infant. ', u'Partly as a result of this, only 34% of births in Pakistan take place in health facilities. Little wonder then that a mother dies of giving birth in Pakistan every 20 minutes, and our ', u'The evidence is clear; the health of both women and children is positively correlated with women\u2019s higher levels of education, greater mobility and decreased observance of ', u'. ', u'The unbending commitment to gender segregation by conservatives is in fact a rejection of women\u2019s physical, mental and emotional well-being.', u'Pakistani patriarchy\u2019s insistence on secluding women in the domestic sphere also severely limits women\u2019s economic participation and independence. ', u'Pakistan has one of the lowest female labour force participation rates in the world \u2013 a mere 22 percent of women are part of the paid labour force, leading to a disproportionately financially powerless female population, overwhelmingly dependent on men for financial sustenance. ', u'Women are hence kept in particularly severe forms of poverty despite the fact that the value of Pakistani women\u2019s unpaid domestic labour has been conservatively estimated by ', u' (nearly a fourth of GDP).', u'As social scientists like ', u' through their research, gendered segregation in the economy is not solely a question of female disadvantage \u2013 it is a norm that actively enables other forms of hierarchy and segmentation in society, preventing the development of more universal group identities and solidarities.', u'It is no accident that gender segregation thrives in our severely unequal society. In both rural and urban areas, the seclusion of women in the private sphere usually serves to keep them away from the possibility of interaction with men of a lower class, caste or status. ', u'Gender segregation hence also inevitably functions as a form of class segregation, limiting the possibility of inter-group interaction and the possibility of familial ties and networks forming across class, caste, ethnic and religious lines. ', u'Such adherence to ', u' empowers an insular parochialism as the dominant mediator of the public sphere, sustaining class hierarchies, and inhibits the development of inclusive public goods and shared community spaces, as is the unfortunate case in Pakistan. ', u'Many of the inequalities engendered by segregation could be addressed through gender-focused policy efforts aimed at rectifying such stark social and economic imbalances. ', u' ', u'Yet the absence of social mobility, educational opportunity and economic clout that results from segregation also places limits on women\u2019s ability to politically organise, resulting in a lack of women\u2019s presence in spaces involving decision-making about their own lives. ', u'Despite advances in women\u2019s efforts to organise politically in recent years, women\u2019s overall political participation remains severely circumscribed; constraints on women\u2019s mobility and literacy lead to registered male voters ', u' (amounting to a mere 78 women for every 100 men registered as voters). ', u'Even smaller proportions of women find representation in legislatures (20 percent in 2013), the majority of them gaining their positions through quotas, often by virtue of their class and familial connections. ', u'Within parties themselves, women often find themselves contained solely to \u2018women\u2019s wings\u2019, which are often ceremonial and ', u' from party decision-making structures. ', u'None of the above is to suggest that women and men should not have separate spheres or they should be forced to desegregate against their will. ', u'Freely-formed single-sex relationships, spaces and associations are not only often desirable, they can be quite necessary in the context of resisting patriarchal excesses, protecting against violence or even, quite simply, for the sharing and discussion of experiences distinct to one\u2019s gender.', u'What needs to be resisted is the mandatory and unequal segregation institutionalised by the state, the clergy and patriarchal socio-cultural institutions, held in place through both indoctrination and violence in order to maintain oppressive gender-based hierarchies. ', u'Psychological research has borne out the case for desegregation; meta-analytic tests of intergroup contact theory have demonstrated how, when groups are socially segregated by racial, gender and other categories, it engenders biases, stereotypes and prejudices about the \u2018other\u2019 group. ', u'In the case of gender segregation, segregated institutions like the military and fraternities are known to produce patterns of behaviour that lead to hyper-masculinity and gender-based violence. ', u'When men exist solely in masculine spaces with little opportunity for normal everyday interaction with women, they are rendered unable to empathise with women\u2019s lived experiences. ', u'This leads to an inability to engage in basic social interaction, resulting in anger or violence in situations of emotional tension and creating public spaces where women are gaped at and harassed shamelessly without any concern for why that might be problematic.', u'Inter-group interaction in shared spaces on the other hand, reduces prejudice and enables empathy, cooperation and solidarity. ', u'In Pakistan\u2019s own context, some of the most peaceful, egalitarian and socially-transformative social movements in recent history \u2013 from the Okara peasant movement for land rights, to the ', u' struggle for housing rights \u2013 that have also fostered ethnic and religious solidarities, have been ones in which men and women have participated shoulder to shoulder with each other. ', u' ', u'The most violent, xenophobic and fascistic movements on the other hand, from the Taliban insurgency to the Faizabad sit-in of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik \u2013 which have achieved literally nothing in terms of social or economic progress for their constituents \u2013 have been exclusively male and rigidly segregationist.', u'The arguments employed by advocates of gender segregation often echo arguments from another dark chapter in human history \u2013 racial apartheid. ', u'The proponents of the pernicious Jim Crow laws in the United States that created separate spheres for black and white people (effectively amounting to apartheid for black people) also used to argue that segregation would \u2018protect\u2019 black people from experiencing racism and violence; that racial segregation was divinely ordained; and that racial mixing was a \u2018direct defiance of God\u2019s Will\u2019. ', u'As history has laid bare, such arguments grounded in divine sanction for inequality and the benevolent \u2018protection\u2019 of oppressed groups often serve simply to secure the privilege of the powerful.', u'Ultimately gender segregation also serves the same purpose \u2013 it protects the interests of patriarchy, securing for men a lifelong supply of free household labour, freeing them from the insecurity of \u2018their\u2019 women engaging with other men and perpetuating their patrilineal spheres of authority within the community and public sphere.', u'We cannot continue to explain away such monumental systemic injustices in the name of morality, cultural relativism or twisted patriarchal interpretations of religion. ', u' ', u'However much Pakistani conservatives and Islamists try to frame gender segregation as simply a moral or religious issue, the reality is that it is a question of the violation of inalienable social, economic and political rights.', u'Our practice of segregation is a form of gendered apartheid that dehumanises women, enables their exclusion and prevents them from experiencing a complete and free human existence. ', u'If we are to tackle gender inequality and other forms of injustice, we must actively dismantle the social, institutional and ideological infrastructure of gender segregation that has been accepted and internalised in our society for far too long.', u'Asma Jahangir\u2019s funeral was radical precisely because it provided a glimpse of a horizon of equality beyond the stifling and unnatural human segmentation we have grown so accustomed to. ', u'That is why it terrified the right-wing vanguard of Pakistani patriarchy. So too must it animate and fuel the efforts of Pakistani progressives fighting for an equal, peaceful and egalitarian future for our society and the world.'], 'link': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1393342/asma-jahangirs-funeral-and-the-ideology-of-gender-segregation', 'heading': u'Asma Jahangir\u2019s funeral and the ideology of gender segregation'}

{'date': u' ', 'text': [u'Naeem Sajjad is a happy man these days. ', u'Since his wife, Ayesha Naeem, started riding the motorbike nearly four months ago, his life has become quite a breeze. ', u'"I\'m less irritable and more relaxed getting home from work every day. I\'m not handed over the list of things to buy on my way from office, nor am I burdened with the thousand and one chores that just need to be done the moment I step inside my home; everything is done before I get home!" he says happily over the phone, from Faisalabad, where he works long hours as a clerk at the University of Agriculture.', u'"She uses my bike and I use the public transport, although at times I do hitch a ride with a colleague!" he adds. ', u'\t\t\t\n', u"As for Sajjad's wife, 35-year old Ayesha Naeem, mother of four, she is loving all the attention she gets on the road. ", u'With her youngest, a year-and-a-half daughter tucked in a baby carrier (which she says she bought from the ', u' for Rs50) harnessed to her chest and her older three behind her, she surfs around town enjoying the thumbs-up and smiles she gets from passersby. ', u'"One day an elderly man came up to me as I was about to get on my bike parked outside a shop and said he was happy that I was not dependent on anyone! He made my day," said Naeem. ', u'She not only drops and picks her kids to and from the school and madrasah every day but also does all the groceries herself now.', u'But while she knows she must always wear a helmet, when it comes to her kids she was clueless about the danger she was putting them in in case of an accident. "That would never happen; I am a very careful rider," was all she had to say in her defence.   ', u'Naeem is among the several dozen in Faisalabad who enrolled themselves in the ', u' (WoW) programme rolled out by the Punjab government in five cities \u2014 Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, Sargodha and Rawalpindi. ', u'\t\t\t\n', u"Launched in 2015 by the Punjab chief minister's ", u' (SRU), it is being carried out in collaboration with the traffic police and the district governments. ', u'It is a way to empower women economically and provide them with a safe mode of transport, believes Salman Sufi, heading the SRU. "One important aspect through which they can prosper is if they are mobile," he tells Images. ', u' says transport plays a crucial role in connecting people to goods, services, social and economic advancement opportunities, and in fostering development. "The lack of personal security, or the inability to use public transport without the fear of being victimised...can substantially decrease the attractiveness of public transit," the report points out.', u'\t\t\t\n', u'Pakistan is no different where women\u2019s mobility outside the home is severely restricted by both social norms and legitimate safety concerns. A ', u' states that 78% of women in Karachi \u201cexperienced sexual harassment or felt harassed or uncomfortable.\u201d ', u'Preliminary findings from Washington DC-based ', u' ', u" of transport challenges faced by women in Lahore echoes Sufi's posit as does a ", u' carried out in 2017 in Lahore, which states that 45% of women participants stated that provision of transport by employers would be a \u201cvery important\u201d factor in choosing whether to take up the job. ', u'Globally, harassment remains unrecognised and seldom discussed in public forums because of social taboos associated with it. Pakistan is no different and so when women do not react to, or report verbal or sexual harassment, it is believed that the problem does not exist. ', u'Referring to their Lahore study, senior research associate and lead author Dr Ammar A Malik says they found that many women were unaware that there exists a formal complaint mechanism. Others, he said, simply had little faith in the police and did not believe that reporting would elicit any response from the latter.', u'Of the transit agency staff who were interviewed, pointed out Malik, all the male drivers and some female security staff had no training on gender-sensitive responses to incidents of sexual harassment or violence should they be reported. There is also no visible signage making riders aware of the various forms of victimisation or punishments per ', u' for perpetrating harassment or violence.', u'\t\t\t\n', u'But apart from feeling more protected, affordability is another main advantage to having your private transport, say women bikers. ', u'"Before I learnt to ride the bike, I would take a rickshaw. The minimum fare I\'d spend was Rs100 in a day; today we fill the bike for Rs500 and it lasts us a good 15 days!" says Naeem after a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation.', u'In its second phase now since early 2018, the WoW programme will provide more than 3,000 customised motorcycles at subsidised rates through a balloting process. "I hope my name comes in the draw," says Naeem excitedly.  ', u"She thinks she fits well within the criteria -- of falling between the ages of 18-40, possessing a valid license. Her other documents are ready, too, which include a passport-sized photograph, a valid CNIC, Punjab domicile certificate, Matriculation certificate and a signed affidavit stating that her or her guardian's maximum income does not exceed Rs30,000. ", u'She has been saving and is ready with not just the Rs3,000 (a non-refundable application fee that has to be submitted to the Bank of Punjab branches) and the down payment of Rs27,000. ', u'"I think we will be able to manage the 12 installments of Rs1,856 monthly," says Naeem. ', u'\t\t\t\n', u'Naeem is lucky not to have invited any negative attention but there are women who worry the idea is too far-fetched in a society that does not allow women to leave their homes. ', u"36-year-old single mother Safina Hussain, who decided to resume her studies after her divorce, often rides her brother's bike to the university or to drop off the kids to school. But many of her relatives have not forgiven her for that. ", u'"They tell my mother that her daughter, a Na\'at-khwan, should not be riding motorbikes!" ', u'Quite tired of this negativity, Hussain says people should not worry that it is un-Islamic. " My riding a motorbike is not going to endanger Islam!" she adds exasperatedly. ', u'Many women riders admit they get more than a few raised eyebrows. ', u'24-year-old Nimra Saleem, working as a graphic designer in a software company in Lahore, continues to face a volley of "catcalls" but remains undeterred. "It does not weigh me down; it is pervasive in our society and whether you are in your private car, using public transport, you will have to face this the moment you step out of your home," she points out helplessly.', u'This is corroborated by Malik. "In our discussions with working women in Lahore, the majority of those traveling by private vehicle reported facing harassment and intimidation even when sitting in the comfort of their cars." The latter complained of lewd gestures, particularly when car windows are rolled down or no male relative is accompanying women drivers, he said. ', u'"Obviously our group is not representative of all women traveling in private vehicles in Lahore, but indicates the gravity of the problem," he added.', u'And yet Saleem refuses to let a few dirty looks cower her down. Having tasted, and for the very first time, "this heady sense of confidence" she refuses is not throwing in the towel.', u'"Harassment doesn\'t weigh me down. Whether you are in your private car or using public transport, you will have to face it the moment you step out of your home." \u2014 Nimra Saleem, graphic designer', u'Fakeha Badar, 29, a government employee in Lahore, says the harassment starts "when I\'m walking to the bus stop, at the bus stop and even inside the bus! I hate it."', u'An only sister, she was encouraged by her father and her three brothers to learn to ride. "I have to change two buses and it takes me an hour and a half to reach work." Days when she\'s getting late she calls Careem or Uber but finds the cab service quite expensive.', u'It also saves Hussain, from Faisalabad, the time and the fare when she uses her brother\'s bike. "It\'s not just about reaching the university, using the bike inside the campus, going from the admin block to the different departments or to the tuck shop, has made my life so much easier!"   ', u'For Badar, though, more than the time it saves to ride herself to the workplace, she says she is saved from the eve-teasing and unsavoury comments that come her way every day. ', u'Unfortunately, she and Hussain both only get to ride once their brothers get home or when they can spare it as their families own only one bike. Both are desperately waiting for their own motorbike and for now both use the bus or the wagon or the rickshaw get to their respective destinations every day. ', u'"Let\'s think of women motorbike riders as something positive happening in our country," says Saleem who is the first in her family who learnt to drive a car and now a motorbike and is proud since "most women can drive a car, but knowing how to ride a motorbike is unique still!"   ', u'"One day an elderly man said he was happy that I was not dependent on anyone! He made my day," says 35-year-old Ayesha Naeem', u'Malik agrees wholeheartedly with Saleem. ', u'"I think it\u2019s a good step that may help eventually change social norms regarding women\u2019s [limited] role in public spaces, as well as change society\u2019s traditional view that a woman\u2019s place is within the ', u' and ', u'," he says. "Women in Pakistan are already marginalised because of poorer access to educational, entertainment and job opportunities, and programs like this could help reduce barriers!" he adds.', u'But he is not sure if women riding motorbikes will necessarily make them feel secure. ', u'"Some might feel even greater harassment and intimidation on the streets," he believes, but hurries to add: "I am not at all suggesting that women should not be driving motorcycles, simply describing what I think may happen."', u"However, taking care of women's safety inside the public transport is really not dealing with the harassment issue completely. ", u'"Women still have to walk to transit stations and then wait at stops, where they\u2019re the most vulnerable," points out Malik. And while the slow transformation takes place, in the interim, he says: "Law enforcement/surveillance can be strengthened to ensure women walking and waiting for transit feel safe."\nAnd that is why the Punjab government is taking on the issue by the horn and teaching the harassers a lesson. ', u"Last year the Chief Minister's SRU, in collaboration with the Punjab Safe Cities Authority and the Punjab Commission on the Status of Women (PCSW), introduced the ", u'.', u'\nWith the app just a click away, a rescue team will arrive in no time to take care of the miscreant. ', u'"They will arrive within 11 minutes!" Salman Sufi claims. 1,000 women have downloaded this app till now but little information is available about how the harasser was punished. "It\'s not just for bikers, but any woman, in any of the 36 districts of Punjab, who needs our help!" he says.      ', u'The WoW programme is also breaking many stereotypes including that of feminine fragility and that because of smaller frames, women may find it challengin to lumber the machine. ', u"Badar does not think the machine is too heavy for her and it's just a myth. ", u'"If a skinny guy can ride it why can\'t a woman?" she counters. ', u'Asked if a scootie would be safer, she responds in the negative saying: "You have to raise your feet up in a scootie but in a bike, if you lose your balance you can quickly place your feet on the ground. She also wears an abaya and says the long gown doesn\'t come in her way as she hitches it up a bit before straddling the machine.

{'date': u' March 04, 2018', 'text': [u'David Kadavy used to post on Facebook without expecting to get paid. Then blockchain came along.', u'After stumbling onto a new corner of the internet based on the digital-ledger technology, Kadavy said he gets paid to post his blog and podcast on Steemit, a website whose text are saved on a blockchain. The site has its own digital currencies, the best-known of which is called Steem, and pays people such as Kadavy who post and comment on the site.', u'Kadavy, a 38-year-old American writer living in Colombia, said he made about $2,000 in January.', u'\u201cI feel like I\u2019m in the Stone Age when I\u2019m on Facebook or Twitter,\u201d Kadavy said. \u201cThey have no value without what you\u2019re contributing to them. If Facebook doesn\u2019t respond to this, things can change very quickly. They should be very concerned.\u201d', u'The so-called financial internet stands the Facebook business model on its head. With Facebook, users post content on the site and the company collects the money \u2014 last year, $41 billion in revenue. On Steemit, the money goes in the other direction. Facebook, with 2.1bn monthly users, may not even see Steemit, which says 9 million users visit each month, in its rear-view mirror. But Kadavy is just one of hundreds of thousands of people who make money by posting, playing games and viewing ads on the new blockchain-based sites and apps, where nearly every user action is linked to token-based compensation.', u'More than 1,000 such projects that record data onto digital ledgers and are called dapps, for decentralised applications, are live or in testing. And they often let users earn their special coins or cryptocurrency by doing something they\u2019d already done for nothing on other sites.', u'Facebook and Twitter didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.', u'Some pre-blockchain sites let users tip content creators from their own funds. Very few did. Sites like Steemit give content creators a portion of newly minted tokens that are being mined all the time. Most of the tokens can be traded on exchanges, so they\u2019re worth something in dollars. And like Steem, many of these coins have appreciated. Steem stands at $3.55, up from 11 cents a year ago.', u'Tokens are a big reason why two-year-old Steemit already has about 100,000 content creators, according to Chief Executive Officer Ned Scott. It just broke into the top 1,000 of the web\u2019s biggest sites, according to tracker Alexa.', u'\u201cI attribute almost all of Steemit\u2019s growth to the reality it\u2019s distributed money to members of the community,\u201d Scott said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s been very little marketing. It\u2019s been all organic conversations that have led to the growth of the platform. A majority of the people who continue to stick around are being compensated for their time.\u201d', u'Scott, a former financial analyst for a food-importing company, got Steemit off the ground with a $250,000 angel investment. The site doesn\u2019t sell ads. Instead, it owns a portion of the issued tokens.', u'This new financial internet is still in its infancy. It pays users a total of $3.5m, but within two years, users could be paid $50m a year, according to Susan Eustis, CEO of WinterGreen Research. The market could expand to $180m within five years, she said in an email. Billionaire investor Tim Draper said that tokens and cryptocurrencies will grab 33 per cent of all commerce in the next 10 years.', u'Sites such as Facebook and Twitter could benefit immediately by allowing users to tip content providers in bitcoin, Draper, one of the world\u2019s biggest investors in digital money, said in an email.', u'While games such as FarmVille have long used virtual currencies, the money can\u2019t be taken out of the games. That\u2019s not the case with tokens. Services like Bancor can convert an obscure token into one that can be traded on an exchange. In a sign of the financial internet\u2019s traction, conversion volume on the Bancor network has climbed to more than $37m per week in January from $3m per week in November, according to the company.', u'Startup Storj pays people to store files for others on unused hard-drive space. Golem will soon let users get paid for letting artists do renderings by using their computers\u2019 power. Users are already making money by taking polls and designing stickers for teen favorite Kik Messenger. Matchpool is set up to let people get paid for matching singles for dates, or for connecting companies with advisers. Augur, which is in beta testing, rewards users for correctly predicting future events. CryptoKitties, a digital game, is a platform for people to collect and breed virtual cats \u2014 and to sell the virtual kittens.', u'CryptoKitties \u201cactually turned out to be my most profitable crypto asset,\u201d player Michael Rinderman, 26, said in an email. Since starting to play the game in early 2018, he turned an investment of one Ether into 10 Ethers; each Ether is currently worth $868.', u'Obstacles stand in the way of the financial internet. New privacy rules in Europe require sites to erase user information under certain circumstances. That could be problematic, as the blockchain is immutable and usually can\u2019t be changed easily.', u'Digital ledgers could also make it difficult to take down libelous content because it lives forever there, said Samit Singh, CEO of Decentralised News Network, an online publisher that\u2019s in alpha testing.', u'More importantly, most digital ledgers have problems scaling as more users jump on board. Recently, Ethereum blockchain screeched to a halt as too many users began playing CryptoKitties.', u'\u201cThese decentralised systems are just not made to grow and scale for the masses yet,\u201d said Anthony Di Iorio, co-founder of Ethereum, said in an interview. \u201cThere are always problems with early technology. It takes time.\u201d', u'But, he notes, it\u2019s worth the wait. \u201cThis will be more important than the internet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be massively disruptive for every sector.\u201d', u'\u2014Bloomberg/Washington Post Service'], 'link': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1393100/websites-using-blockchain-to-pay-users-aim-to-disrupt-facebook', 'heading': u'Websites using blockchain to pay users aim to disrupt Facebook'}

{'date': u' March 04, 2018', 'text': [u'\t\t\t\n', u'Millennials have been accused of disrupting many industries, from newspapers to brick-and-mortar stores. Credit cards appear to be next in line.', u'Just one out of three millennials carries plastic, according to a Bankrate.com survey, compared to the majority of older Americans. In addition, a Fed survey found the 18 to 24 demographic preferred to pay cash more than others. And if they do carry a card, it tends to be of the prepaid or debit variety, TD Bank found.', u'None of that bodes well for banks like JPMorgan Chase or payment networks like Visa and MasterCard, since the fees they earn from debit card transactions are less than those earned via credit cards. The 2008 global financial crisis and ballooning college tuition may have also scared some millennials away.', u'\u201cThey experienced the Great Recession just as they were beginning school or starting their career, pondering about buying a home,\u201d said Erin Currier, Director of Financial Security and Mobility at Pew Charitable Trusts. \u201cThey\u2019re very sensitive to this life experience.\u201d', u'Millennials are more likely than older generations to have student loans to pay. About 41 per cent of them held such debt, according to a 2015 Pew report. That compares to, at their peaks, 26pc for Generation X; 13pc for Baby Boomers; and 3pc for the Silent Generation.', u'And the burden is heavier, too: From 1990 to 2015, student debt for the typical college bachelor\u2019s degree increased about 164pc, according to Education Department data.', u'Those big obligations could explain millennials\u2019 aversion to borrowing, Currier said. Over time, they may never grow as comfortable with credit cards and debt as previous generations have, she said.', u'TransUnion confirms millennials carry fewer cards and have lower balances than Gen-Xers did when the latter group was aged 21-34, thanks in part to legislation limiting the marketing of credit cards on campus and the subsequent boom in the use of debit cards. ', u'Millennials have also increased the use of auto and personal loans, TransUnion found, at the expense of credit cards.', u'Take Bo King, a 26-year-old who applied for his first credit card about a year ago. He grew up cautious after watching friends and family pile up thousands in debt. King, who works in retail, has been using a debit card since turning 18, but knew he would need a credit history to be able to buy a house.', u'\u201cI\u2019ve always been skeptical about getting a credit card,\u201d King said. Eventually, though, \u201cI saw it as a necessary evil.\u201d', u'It\u2019s an evil some millennials will shift to from prepaid and debit cards as they get older, according to a study by payment processor TSYS Merchant Solutions, which shows credit cards becoming the preferred method of payment after age 25.', u'That\u2019s the saving grace for the card companies. A breakdown of balances by age suggests that the older people get, the more they rely on credit cards. ', u'A FICO study showed 18- to 24-year-olds had an average balance of just over $2,000. With 25- to 34-year-olds, the number almost doubled, said Ethan Dornhelm, vice president of Analytics and Scores from FICO.', u'\u201cAs millennials grow older and more affluent, the ownership of credit cards and the need for and desire for credit cards will increase,\u201d said Solana Cozzo, VP of Prepaid and Financial Inclusion at Mastercard.', u'They\u2019re not only expected to change their spending habits when they have children, but they\u2019re also more likely to be in tune with the awards credit card companies bestow, like airline miles and cash back on purchases.', u'Perhaps the issuers should tie rewards to student loan debt. Sam DeMario, a 20-year-old finishing his undergraduate degree, has been putting off getting a credit card until he can earn a bit more money and start paying off his school bills.', u'\u201cOnce I\u2019ve been accepted into a graduate program and have a stipend that I can report as income, I don\u2019t see a reason not to have one,\u201d he said.', u'Bloomberg/ The Washington Post Service'], 'link': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1393096/debt-conscious-millennials-ditch-credit-cards-threaten-industry', 'heading': u'Debt-conscious millennials ditch credit cards, threaten industry'}

That\u2019s exactly what happened to two citizens last week, who were booked under Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code for throwing garbage on the main road.', u'Now public littering is definitely not acceptable, and many less considerate citizens have a nasty habit of disposing of trash in front of others\u2019 houses.

Never mind the fact that there\u2019s no citywide waste collection and management system.

Should we let it pile up and rot in our homes? Surely that is no solution.', u'What is needed is a proper waste management system for Karachi; the fact that this megacity of Pakistan lacks such a system is nothing but criminal. Experts have pointed out the threat of diseases spreading amongst the citizenry due to the piles of trash that dot the metropolis, but the authorities seem unmoved.', u'Ideally, the city government should be in charge of collecting trash, with the provincial administration having a supervisory role.

{'date': u' March 04, 2018', 'text': [u'MUZAFFARABAD: The Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Supreme Court on Friday remanded an important case to the high court in which the 12 seats of AJK legislative assembly for the Pakistan based Kashmiri refugees has been challenged. ', u'The court has been directed to conduct proceedings as required under law and decide the same after providing opportunity of hearing to the parties concerned. ', u'The apex court bench, comprising Chief Justice Chaudhry Mohammad Ibrahim Zia and Justice Raja Saeed Akram Khan, gave this decision while setting aside a judgment of the high court in the case. ', u'In June 2014, three senior advocates Karam Dad Khan, Raja Amjad Ali Khan and Raja Raza Ali Khan (the last one now advocate general) had filed a petition in the high court for annulment of the 12 seats, six of which are reserved for refugees from held Kashmir Valley and as many for refugees from held Jammu region. ', u'However, the petition was dismissed in limine on March 31, 2016, on the ground that the controversy had already been resolved by the high court and, ultimately, by the apex court in another case titled Shah Ghulam Qadir vs Sardar Gul-e-Khandan and eight others. ', u'An appeal against the high court decision was filed by Mr Karam Dad Khan and Raja Amjad Ali Khan in May 2016 but hearings on it were held in July, November and December of last year. ', u'In its decision on the appeal, the apex court bench declared that although the writ petition was dismissed in limine through the impugned judgment, keeping in view the sensitivity and importance of the issue the parties were provided with ample opportunity to argue the same. ', u'Even the person who was not party but possessed rich knowledge on the genesis of Kashmir issue was also invited to assist the court, the bench observed, referring to the amicus curiae Dr Syed Nazir Gillani, the London based president of Jammu Kashmir Council for Human Rights. ', u'While noting that it would not like to pre-empt the jurisdiction of the high court by conclusively determining the propositions raised in the case, the bench held that the high court had dismissed the petition on technical grounds instead of deciding it on merits. ', u'It appeared that the high court had confined itself only to the question of vires of the provisions of sub section ii and iii of section 2 of AJK Election Ordinance, 1970, whereas the other related propositions remained unattended, it said. ', u'\u201cThe sole reason advanced for dismissal of petition in limine is also result of some misconception and does not appear to be just and proper course. The important and serious constitutional legal propositions raised in the case require proper appreciation and determination by the high court so that the issue can be conclusively settled once and for all,\u201d declared the bench. ', u'\u201cIn this context, we restrain ourselves to express our opinion relating to any of the issues raised in the light of the arguments of the parties. All these propositions are left open to be firstly attended to and resolved by the high court,\u201d it added.
