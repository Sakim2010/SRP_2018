" May 01, 2018","ON Saturday evening, Michelle Wolf, a comedian who broke into the business on late-night television and The Daily Show, scandalised a village inhabited by politicians, lobbyists and reporters by … wait for it … being a comedian.,Wolf, the latest professional wit invited to entertain those gathered at the annual White House Correspondents’ Association dinner by roasting the president, the media and the rest of the Washington establishment, cracked wise, funny, ruthless, cruel and vulgar jokes for 19 minutes about subjects near and dear to those stakeholders.,She took on topics like the White House assault on facts; how women’s issues, political spin, and dissembling intersect uncomfortably with luminaries such as Ivanka Trump, Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders; President Donald Trump’s possible dalliance with a porn star, his wealth and his courtship of white nationalists; Ted Kennedy and Chappaquiddick; Al Franken and sexual harassment; Democratic ineptitude; and the tangled, symbiotic relationship between journalists and the president.,“And just a reminder to everyone, I’m here to make jokes,” Wolf said at the top of her routine. “I have no agenda. I’m not trying to get anything accomplished. So everyone that’s here from Congress, you should feel right at home.”,Lots of the dinner guests, we now know, did not end up feeling right at home as Wolf toed the line between being provocative and being offensive — a line that comedy, particularly political comedy, routinely blurs. Many of the critical responses to Wolf’s caustic monologue wound up showing the extent to which the joke here truly is on tribal, insular Washington itself, and why cosy media events like Saturday’s dinner are inevitably uncomfortable and better off put to rest.,A tour around some of the reactions to Wolf — whom journalists invited to the dinner to exercise her own ribald form of free speech — also throws some Trump-era hypocrisies into relief.,Dennis Miller, a conservative political comedian and Saturday Night Live veteran, seemed to forget that he’s an occasionally nasty comedian himself when he took to Twitter over the weekend to slam Wolf. Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, was so put off by Wolf’s routine that he and his wife fled the dinner. Fair enough. But the Schlapps weren’t so insulted that they couldn’t continue to partake in the event’s other vaguely swampy festivities. They reportedly showed up at a swanky after-party hosted by NBC at the Art Museum of the Americas.,Journalists — liberal, iconoclastic, free-speaking journalists — also took to Twitter to criticise Wolf or sympathise with her targets, notably Sanders. Perhaps not surprisingly, the president’s press secretary got some of the most rousing support from veterans of the fourth estate, including Andrea Mitchell.,I’m not so sure that Wolf was the “worst” since Don Imus skewered Bill Clinton for his extramarital affairs and Hillary Clinton for her legal problems at a media dinner in Washington back in 1996. Remember Stephen Colbert’s savage roasting of President George W Bush at the Correspondents’ Dinner in 2006? That was pretty brutal (and uncomfortable and funny). How about Seth Meyers teeing up Trump at the 2011 instalment? Tough stuff. And funny. (And maybe the reason Trump hasn’t shown up at the last two dinners.),Sanders is an interesting exhibit in Washington tribalism. She has presided over myriad press conferences in which she has gone out of her way to insult the reporters present, while also accusing the press of “purposefully misleading the American people”. She also regularly goes to bat for a boss who has described the media as the “enemy of the American people”. Some of Sanders’s supporters in the press complained that Wolf made fun of the press secretary’s looks. I thought that Wolf was making fun of the press secretary’s demeanour and character; that’s a distinction with a difference.,In the meantime, it’s worth identifying the real problem with the Correspondents’ Association dinner: journalists enter perilous territory when they take too much pleasure in getting dressed up and going out with the people they write about.,The event is firmly part of a certain nostalgic Washington tradition, one that’s rooted in the idea that there’s a shared faith in the fundamental value of fact-based journalism. But there isn’t. And that’s a fact that can’t be obscured by the kind of bland humour for which Wolf’s critics seem to pine.,So let’s just stop trying.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1404913/hey-washington-the-jokes-really-on-you,"Hey, Washington, the joke’s really on you

"May 01, 2018 02:51pm","COLOMBO: Sri Lanka is celebrating its most important annual Buddhist festival, Vesak — celebrated on the first full moon in the month of May. Sacred relics from both India and Pakistan, have been sent to the country to be displayed for the devotees of the Buddhist faith. ,Relics of the Buddha brought to Sri Lanka from Sarnath in India and those brought from the Taxila Museum in Pakistan, will be placed at several temples to commemorate the birth, enlightenment and death of the Buddha. ,The relics from Sarnath, India, carried by the General Secretary of the Maha Bodhi Society of Calcutta, Ven. P. Seewali Thera, were received by India’s High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu, and presented to Sri Lanka’s parliament speaker Karu Jayasuriya. ,The relics — brought to Sri Lanka for the first time in more than a century — were enshrined, at Mulagandhakuti Vihara in Sarnath, in Uttar Pradesh India. Sarnath is a place of holy significance for the Buddhist faith, as it was in the village, in a deer park, where Gautama Buddha is said to have delivered his first sermon, giving birth to the Buddhist sangha — the community of monks, who have achieved a significant level of enlightenment. ,Anagarika Dharmapala, the Sri Lankan founder of the Maha Bodhi Society of India, built the Mulagandhakuti Vihara to restore the glory of Sarnath. The relics of the Buddha were presented as gifts to the Maha Bodhi Society by the Government of India. ,The relics sent by Pakis­tan were received by Bud­dha Sasana Minister Gam­ini Jayawickrema Perera and the Pakistan High Commissioner in Sri Lanka, Dr Shahid Hashmat. ,Dr Hashmat said that the artefacts are a priceless part of the archaeological heritage of Pakistan and depict the rich Buddhist tradition of the country. ,The high commission of Pakistan in Sri Lanka, in a statement, said that Pakistan is keen to take part in the celebrations. The various artefacts will be on display, till May 2, at the Temple Trees, the official residence of the Sri Lankan Prime Minister. From May 3 to May 12, the relics will be placed at several temples across the island. ,A casket has been specially designed to secure the two most revered relics from India and Pakistan. The relics, enclosed in the silver casket, enshrined in the Vihara, were excavated by Sir John Marshall in 1913-14, near the ancient city of Taxila, (Takshashila). ,They were found in a small Buddhist chapel close to the Dharmarajika Stupa in a silver reliquary — a container for holy relics — with inscriptions dating back to the year 136 (circa 79AD). The second relic enshrined at Sarnath was found by A. H. Longhurst of the Archaeological Survey of India in 1929 in a large Stupa at Nagarjunakonda in the Guntur District of the then Madras Presidency. The Stupa in which the relic was found is described as the Maha Chetiyaor — the ‘Great Stupa’ of the Blessed One. The relics will be displayed — among other areas — in the districts of Colombo, Matara, Anuradhapura and Kandy. All displays will be open for the public till May 16. ,Buddhism was founded in India, 2600 years ago. It spread across the Indian subcontinent and extended to nearby regions, but lost significance in its birthplace due to the revival of Hindu sects like Shaivism and Vaishnavism. The faith however, thrived in many other regions including far east states like Myanmar, and Thailand. Today, Sri Lanka and Bhutan are the only Buddhist majority countries in the Indian subcontinent. Strategically important for both Pakistan and India, Sri Lanka has always been extended friendly diplomacy through the preservation of Buddhist relics.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1404896/ancient-relics-sent-to-sri-lanka-to-commemorate-birth-of-buddha,"Ancient relics sent to Sri Lanka to commemorate birth of Buddha

But in seeking to deny access to Telegram, the state telecoms regulator blocked millions of IP addresses, disrupting the work of many businesses including car manufacturer Volvo.,Facebook and Telegram are widely used by the opposition to coordinate protests and make political statements.

For this reason, GST on petrol, kerosene and light diesel oil was slightly reduced and that on high speed diesel kept unchanged at 27.5pc.” ,The price of high speed diesel (HSD) was increased by 2.31pc, petrol by 1.98pc, kerosene by 4.45pc and light diesel oil (LDO) by 5.43pc. The ex-depot price of HSD was raised by Rs2.31 to Rs98.76 per litre from Rs96.45 and that of petrol by Rs1.70 to Rs87.70 from Rs86. The price of kerosene was increased by Rs3.41 to Rs79.87 per litre from Rs76.46 and that of LDO by Rs3.55 to Rs68.85 from Rs65.30. ,Ogra had proposed an increase of Rs5.02 per litre in the price of HSD, Rs3.22 in motor gasoline (petrol), Rs6.97 in kerosene and Rs6.95 in LDO. Interestingly, the regulator had calculated the prices on the basis of higher than notified tax rates for HSD on the order of the finance ministry to enable the government to announce a relatively lower rate for political objectives. ,The ministry had ordered calculation of prices on the basis of 31pc GST on HSD and 17pc on all other products. This was despite the fact that the notified-GST rate stood at 27.5pc on HSD, 17pc on kerosene, 16.5pc on LDO and 21.5pc on petrol. ,Under the practice in vogue, oil prices are revised on the last day of every month. ,Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has been allowing a gradual increase in the prices of LDO and kerosene to bridge a price differential with petrol to minimise mixing of the two products. ,Interestingly, kerosene is the only regulated petroleum product but unavailable at the fixed rate anywhere in the country.

Bashir Baloch, the well-known folk singer of the city — he has so far been given 132 awards, including two presidential awards, over his career — sits gloomily at his residence. There is no one else in the room; just him and his awards. ,In his highly conservative area of Killi Deba, situated in the heart of the city, I humbly request him to sing a song of his favourite singer. After some thought, and trying to bring some semblance of a smile on his lips, he agrees to sing one of Lata Mangeshkar’s songs. As he finishes, he tells me: “You know, I came to know about her at the age of 7, and liked her work so much that I started singing her songs at the age of 11.”,In his vicinity, almost everyone knows Bashir Baloch. Had that not been the case, the narrow alleys leading to his impoverished house would be hard to navigate correctly. “I was recently at the Chief Minister House from 11am to 9pm,” he continues. “I was promised a meeting with Chief Minister Abdul Quddus Bizenjo, but unfortunately he was busy the whole day. Finally, I pleaded to be allowed to come back home. He could not take out even five minutes for a meeting with me.”,Gone are the days when Bashir Baloch would, besides other programmes, be regularly invited on , and ,, the state-run TV channel. With the remuneration he received, he supported his family. ,But then, explains Baloch writer Waheed Zaheer, the private TV channel boom occurred after the turn of the millennium, followed by the social media revolution. “Now, there are channels after channels, so who will watch Bashir Baloch on ,, or listen to him on ,?” asks Zaheer. “Times have changed.” ,Bashir Baloch has seven children and his eldest daughter is 16. The family lives hand to mouth. There is someone, he says, by the name of Nisar Shahwani who enrolled his children at a school in Deba, and also sends wheat for his family annually. “Had Nisar not stretched out his hand, I would not have been able to even send my children to school,” the singer says. ,Besides Balochi and Brahui, he sings in six languages; singing is his life. In Balochistan and elsewhere in the country, Bashir Baloch says he has been respected wherever he has gone. People always know him, he says, and several people he has met in recent times have given him money despite the fact that they themselves were hard up. “What I need is some sort of official support from the government, so that I may continue my singing and financially support my family,” he explains. “As a folk singer, I think I should not be asking for financial assistance. But what else I can do? If this doesn’t happen, I will die from hunger along with the children.”,It is said that at the time of the 1965 war between India and Pakistan, singer Madam Noor Jehan boosted the morale of the armed forces, which made her even more popular. “That is what inspired me, too, as a singer,” says Bashir Baloch. “I did sing those songs of hers with a lot of interest, because Pakistan is my motherland.” ,Folk singing is a herculean task. Among thousands, it is said, one folk singer is born. In a stunted society such as ours, they are unfortunately born to suffer endlessly. According to former Balochi Academy chairman Abdul Wahid Bandeeg, all of Balochistan’s folk singers’ story is the same as that of Bashir Baloch. “There is no end to their economic sufferings,” Bandeeg says.,Echoing this claim, Bashir Baloch says he would happily sing, but he has had to finally give up. There are, according to him, some 20 more folk singers in Quetta who are facing the same fate as his, but they are suffering silently. “I am not brave like them,” he says, his eyes brimming with tears. “They suffer, they sing, and they keep silent.

It was still unclear if such measures could bring permanent peace because no major breakthrough in the North Korean nuclear standoff was produced after ,. ,South Korean soldiers disassembled loudspeakers at multiple front-line areas before pulling them away from the border, according to Seoul's Defence Ministry. A ministry official, speaking anonymously citing department rules, gave no further details such as how long the dismantling work would continue. ,South Korean media reported that Seoul detected signs that North Korea was taking similar steps on Tuesday. But the Defence Ministry says it cannot confirm the report. ,Both Koreas before the summit had halted propaganda broadcasts along the 248-kilometre-long border. ,Cold War-era propaganda warfare had resurfaced in 2016 when tensions rose sharply after the North's fourth nuclear test. Seoul broadcast criticism of the North's abysmal human rights conditions, world news and weather forecasts as well as pop songs. The North broadcast anti-South messages and praises of its own political system. ,North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has suspended nuclear and missile tests and placed his nuclear program up for negotiation, but scepticism lingers about how serious he is and what disarmament steps he would eventually take. ,Some experts say Kim's sincerity would be tested during his planned meeting with President Donald Trump in what would be the first-ever North Korea-US summit talks since the end of their fighting in the 1950-53 Korean War. ,Trump said on Monday he likes the idea of going to the southern side of Panmunjom, the place for the Korean summit, to meet Kim, though he said Singapore was also under consideration. He said on Saturday that his meeting with Kim could happen in the next three to four weeks. ,During Friday's summit, Kim told South Korean President Moon that he would shut down his country's only known nuclear testing site in May and allow outside experts and journalists to watch the process. ,Kim also said he would be willing to give up his nuclear programs if the United States commits to a formal end to the Korean War and a pledge not to attack the North, according to South Korea's presidential office. ,Some experts downplayed the significance of the closing of the Punggy-ri test site, where six underground explosions have been conducted and which the doubters believe may be too unstable for another. Kim denied such views, saying the site has two underground tunnels to be used for new tests. ,During a telephone call with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday, Moon said he wants the UN to observe the work to close down the Punggy-ri site. Moon also asked for the UN to formally declare its support for his recent summit declaration with Kim, and Guterres responded he'll try to contribute for an establishment of peace on the Korean Peninsula, according to Moon's office. ,According to their summit accord, Kim and Moon agreed to achieve “a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula through complete denuclearisation,” rather than clearly stating “a nuclear-free North Korea.” ,North Korea has long said the term “denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula” must include the United States pulling its 28,500 troops out of South Korea and removing its so-called “nuclear umbrella” security commitment to South Korea and Japan. ,Kim could offer more disarmament concessions during his meeting with Trump, and some analysts say Kim may announce scraping North Korea's long-range missile program, which has posed a direct threat to the United States.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1404997/south-korea-dismantles-propaganda-loudspeakers-at-border,"South Korea dismantles propaganda loudspeakers at border

She also observed that the outgoing government had no legal and moral authority to present a full year budget. ,She chided the government for its non-serious attitude towards parliament as there was not a single minister present when the session began. Of the 104 members of the Senate, only 26 were present in the house, nine of them were on the treasury benches. “Mr Chairman, ask those who talk about the sanctity of the vote where their ministers have gone,” she said, while addressing Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani. ,She slammed the government for presenting what she called a “lame duck budget”. ,PM’s adviser says no justification for imposing financial emergency ,“The future of Pakistan is at risk. This is a lame duck budget by a lame duck government. This is pre-poll rigging,” claimed Ms Rehman. “This is a borrowing, billionaire’s and , (disaster) budget,” she emphasised. ,Commenting on the fall in textile exports, she said Pakistan’s textile industry contributed 57 per cent of the country’s exports, but had lost its global textile share by 23pc. She said that 150 mills had shut down, which was alarming because Pakistan was the fifth largest cotton producer in the world. ,Pointing out lucanae in the proposed budget, Ms Rehman said: “Our circular debt has reached a whopping Rs1 trillion. We are the seventh most stressed water nation and only Rs38bn has been allocated for water without any details.” ,She said the public debt, which was Rs13 trillion during the Pakistan Peoples Party’s (PPP) term had soared to a massive Rs22 trillion. ,“Pakistan’s entire budget is based on borrowing to pay back more loans. How can the government not call this a financial emergency? The next government will face a nightmare of repayment and no revenue stream,” Ms Rehman elaborated. ,She said that 30pc tax concessions had been given to billionaires in the current budget but there was nothing for the poor. The government had provided no relief for the masses, she added, instead the burden remained on the poor. ,“Why has the government given tax concessions on imported LNG and none to Pakistani gas? The Qatar LNG deal is already marred by controversy. To this day, we don’t know what is under the black ink used to block transparency on the contract with Qatar Gas,” she said. ,The Senator pointed out that the NFC award had not been disbursed in five years. “How can they determine where the federal slew of consolidated indirect taxes like the economic fund will go without the NFC award?

The government should stop mocking state institutions,” she stressed. Dismissing the opposition’s objections, Adviser to the PM Haroon Akhtar said there was no justification for a financial emergency, which he noted was there during the previous PPP regime. ,Mr Akhtar, who joined the proceedings towards the end of the session, said the country’s economic situation had improved, and the government was leaving with twice the revenue it had inherited.

The defence ministry now wants this year’s allocation to be compared with the revised figures, instead of the original allocation, because it wants to avoid the sharp rise in defence spending getting public attention. ,“Defence budget for the year 18-19 stands at Rs1,100bn which is 10.2pc increase to the closing year. The routine yearly increase ranges between 10pc and 12pc which caters for inflation, depreciation, rise in pay etc,” the ministry said. ,“This year increase in defence budget is also considered a normal increase, keeping in view all internal and external challenges posed to Pakistan,” it added. ,Journalists usually measure the defence allocations in terms of the percentage increase over previous year. This does not give a correct view. Therefore, defence budgets for a more realistic analysis are measured in terms of percentage of both overall public spending and of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). ,Defence spending share in terms of both total outlay of the budget and percentage of GDP have been going up. Over the past decade or so defence spending was reduced to less than 3pc (around 2.6pc) of GDP and similarly its share in the national pie was also reduced to well under 20pc.

"May 01, 2018 07:49am","ISLAMABAD: Water shortage is exceeding official estimates amid Tarbela Dam hitting dead level for the second time in a fortnight. The development will be a serious challenge for Kharif crops in Sindh and Balochistan.,Officials said the existing water resource at Tarbela dam was heading towards dead level in two days and there were no immediate signs of improving river flows in the catchment of Northern parts of the country.,They said conservation level at two reservoirs — Tarbela and Mangla — had reached dead level almost a month ago and mostly remained so until mid-April.,They said current storage at Tarbela was around 4-feet that would exhaust within two days at the current rate of discharges of 40,000 cusec compared to 35,000 cusec of inflows. In fact, the discharges were reduced to 40,000 cusec on Monday from previous level of 45,000 cusec because of precarious circumstances.,The officials said the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) had estimated up to 40 per cent water shortage for early-Kharif period which is now being anticipated to go beyond 44pc if river flows do not improve in a day. As a consequence, the provincial inter-provincial bickering is emerging over discharges as provincial irrigation authorities seek greater control over limited resources.,The sources said Punjab on Monday asked the water regulator to reduce discharges from Mangla dam from 28,000 cusec to 25,000 cusec as flows in river Chenab had improved and would be suffice to meet its irrigation requirements. ,However, Irsa rejected the demand fearing it would create serious issues at Chashma barrage and may need closure of Taunsa-Panjnad (TP) Link Canal and hence releases from Mangla could not be reduced at this stage. Instead, the regulator said it was shifting 4200cusec from Taunsa-Panjnad to Jehlum-Chenab zone.,On the other hand, Sindh irrigation department warned that while storage at Tarbela was just 4-feet above 1,386-feet operating level, the storage at Mangla was 53-feet higher than operating level of 1,103-feet. It protested that despite this situation, discharges were still in progress from Tarbela against conservation at Mangla.,“Further transfer of water from Indus to Jhelum-Chenab System through CJ canal and TP Link Canal is being continued” despite the fact that water availability on Indus was on the lower side than Jhelum-Chenab zone,” Sindh government said.,Sindh feared that “acute water shortage crisis in the province will be further aggravated” within 1-2 days if the trend continued, forcing dam operations purely on run-of-the river basis and the Sindh would have no other option “except to defer operation of right bank canals of Guddu and Sukkur barrages, which will obviously affect the supplies to Balochistan canals of Pat Feeder and Kirthar also.,Therefore, Sindh demanded immediate end to transfer of water from Indus to Jhelum-Chenab system and requirements of Trimmu, Panjnad and Sindh canals be fulfilled by releasing more water from Mangla.,Kharif season starts from April 1 to November 30, and rice, sugarcane, cotton and maize are some of the key crops.,According to the latest data released by Irsa on Monday, the Tarbela dam was at 1390-feet against its dead level of 1,386-feet, with inflows of 34,900 cusecs and outflows of 45,000 cusecs. ,The Water level at the Mangla dam stood at 1,103-feet against its dead level of 1,040-feet. ,Inflows at Mangla were recorded at 33,200 cusecs against outflows of 28,000 cusecs.

Cotton, which should be planted latest by first week of May is also a casualty, since the water was supposed to come on Monday but it has not come, and what is on the way is less than one foot, which will reduce to two inches by the time it reaches the watercourses. Its a disaster!” he exclaims.,In Khoski and Shadi Large also in southern Badin, scuffles have been reported among people gathered at filter plants for drinking water.,Similar situation exists in Punjab which normally has an advantage of being upper riparian and historically Sindh always complained of being deprived from its due share of irrigation water.,But today both the leading provinces in agriculture sector are faced with similar situation of acute shortage of irrigation water to the extent that all the Kharif crops are at stake. ,Talking to Dawn via telephone, Mian Mahmood Ahmed, a leading ginner and founder member of Rahimyar Khan Chamber, said that being member of district coordination committee, he attended a meeting in the Deputy Commissioner’s office on Monday in this regard. “The water situation is so grim that people were not interested in getting irrigation water but were asking for drinking water,” he said.  ,Mr Ahmed further said that due to no irrigation water, people complained that they even don’t have green fodder (chaara) for their animals. ,He said that since December last year, irrigation water was not available but at the government level it seems the policy makers are least worried and are leading normal life. The rivers are dry and people are running from pillar to post in search of drinking water, he said.,Responding to a question, he said, “We are in a situation where all development works should be stopped and country’s entire resources be diverted for the construction of dams particularly Kalabagh dam.”,Mian Ahmed pointed out that recently even the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) spokesman accepted a fact that after the flow of water to both Punjab and Sindh to 34,700 cusecs and 31,000 cusecs, respectively the former is still facing shortage of irrigation water up to 52pc and later by 35pc.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1404885/agri-lands-parched-large-crop-damage-cotton-sowing-disrupted,"Agri lands parched, large crop damage, cotton sowing disrupted

" May 01, 2018","WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump hasn’t decided whether to extend relief for allied nations from US steel and aluminium tariffs, creating uncertainty in global metals markets with temporary exemptions set to expire in less than 24 hours. ,“The president has not made any decision yet,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business Network in an interview that aired Monday, when asked about extending exemptions to trading partners.,“We’ve been having lots of discussions internally, we’ve been having lots of discussions with our counterparts,” he said, adding: “We’re addressing these issues real time.”,Mnuchin’s comments were similar to those of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who said late Saturday that the White House will announce its decision on tariffs right before the May 1 deadline.,Trump last month imposed 25 per cent tariffs on steel imports and 10pc on aluminium. But he gave temporary reprieves to Aus­tralia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Mexico and South Korea, and directed US Trade Representative Robert Ligh­t­­hizer to handle negotiations with countries seeking exemptions.,So far, South Korea is the only nation to be spared from the duties, though nations including France and Germany have been pushing for the EU to be excluded.,“The president gave us time to address these issues and the president is going to make a decision,” Mnuchin said. “I expect that there will be a decision quickly.”,Trump’s embrace of tariffs this year has roiled financial markets and sparked fears of a trade war that could undermine the broadest global upswing in years. The EU has threatened to retaliate with duties on iconic American goods such as Harley-Davidson motorcycles and Kentucky bourbon.,The steel decision comes days before Mnuchin and other senior members of Trump’s cabinet travel to China in search of a deal that would head off a brewing trade dispute between the world’s two-biggest economies. Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on as much as $150 billion in Chinese imports, while Beijing has vowed to respond with duties on everything from American soybeans to airplanes.,“We’re looking to have a very frank discussion on trade, on the issues of the trade imbalance,” Mnuchin said. “President Trump has been very clear for the last year that he’s very focused on the trade deficit, and we’re looking to correct that.”,The US had a $337bn trade deficit in goods and services with China last year. Trump has asked China to cut the gap by $100bn and open up the Asian nation’s markets to American products such as cars. But Chinese officials will refuse to discuss the $100bn demand at talks in Beijing this week, the New York Times reported, citing unidentified people.,In exchange for a permanent exemption from the metals tariffs, the Trump administration is pushing countries to accept quotas on the amount of steel and aluminium they export to the US. South Korea accepted a quota of 70pc of the average of its steel exports to the US between 2015 and 2017, which can come in tariff-free.,The US Aluminium Association last week sent a letter asking Trump to grant exemptions to all “responsible” trade partners. But over the weekend, Century Alumi­nium Co. Chief Executive Officer Mike Bless, leading the second-largest US aluminium producer, echoed the Commerce Department’s original recommendations to the president that said all imports must be subject to either quotas or tariffs.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1404875/trump-keeps-allies-guessing-on-steel-tariffs-as-deadline-looms,"Trump keeps allies guessing on steel tariffs as deadline looms

" May 01, 2018","LONDON: After bouncing up, falling down and keeping investors on the edges of their seats, bitcoin may be maturing into a period of relatively boring stability, experts say.,A worldwide wave of regulation has led to a collapse in trading volumes. Cryptocurrency advertisements are disappearing from top internet pages, and bitcoin no longer dominates Google searches.,As investors try to figure out what bitcoin wants to be when it grows up, the best-known cryptocurrency is going through somewhat of an existential crisis.,“It needs a new narrative,” said Nicholas Colas, New York-based founder of investment research firm DataTrek. “There is every chance that if there is some sort of institutional involvement, there could be a move higher.” Bitcoin rallied 25 per cent in April after crashing 70pc from a high near $20,000 late last year.,The cryptocurrency landscape has indeed changed. Mom-and-pop investors who drove bitcoin’s skyrocket rise in 2017 have been pushed aside by government bans on trading, and replaced by cryptocurrency funds, wealthy individuals and established financial firms.,The bigger players can make bigger moves, but their trades are often obscured by screens on over-the-counter (OTC) brokerages and matching platforms.,They are also less likely to chase sudden swings in bitcoin’s value, being more interested in the potential of unproven but promising blockchain technology.,Average daily traded volumes across cryptocurrency exchanges fell to $9.1 billion in March and to $7.4bn in the first half of April, compared with almost $17bn in December, according to data compiled by crypto analysis website CryptoCompare.,Several exchanges saw their daily trading volumes drop by more than half between December and March, including Bitfinex, Poloniex, Coinbase and Bitstamp, the data shows.,Cryptocurrencies’ biggest-ever trading day was Dec. 22, when volumes topped $30bn, according to CryptoCompare.,On April 8, volume sagged to $4.6bn, the weakest day since last October, according to the data.,The theory that bigger institutions will make bitcoin markets less volatile and more liquid has grown as new OTC exchanges and platforms spring up, carrying names such as Circle, Octagon Strategy, Cumberland and Kraken.,Digital exchange Gemini’s new block trading product allows high-volume trades that will be invisible to other traders until the orders are filled.,Cumberland, one of the biggest block traders, has counterparties in more than 35 countries and quotes two-way prices in about 35 crypto assets.,Gatecoin, a Hong Kong-based crypto exchange, saw retail volumes plunge from peaks of $100 million a day last September, said Aure­lien Menant, its founder and chief executive.,But, he said, as institutional players enter the market, OTC trades hidden from view have pushed up overall volumes in a way that doesn’t show up in data. Gatecoin also operates an OTC platform.,Few institutions have gone public about their plans to trade cryptocurrencies, and many asset managers say they still aren’t sure the digital currency is more than a fad.,But a , survey this week found one in five financial institutions is considering trading cryptocurrencies in the next 12 months. Of those, 70pc said they planned to start trading in the next three to six months.,In the meantime, the price of bitcoin may be stabilising, at least on paper. The futures market shows bitcoin staying nearly flat — between $8,900 and $9,050 — until September.,Gatecoin’s Menant, however, is considerably more bullish. He reckons the currency might end the year above $100,000, but acknowledges that’s a gamble.,Joe Duncan, founder of Singapore-based Fintech firm Duncan Capital, expects to see retail investors return to trading as governments slowly relax their cryptocurrency rules.,“But bitcoin could still lose some market dominance,” Duncan said.,Thomas Lee, managing partner and co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors in New York, said the bitcoin market is languishing in a “purgatory” phase somewhere between a bear and a bull market. He predicted that could continue until at least September.,One issue is that although many of the big institutions are curious about how bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology could revolutionise the financial sector, bitcoin isn’t widely accepted as currency and has no intrinsic value.,That, and the currency’s intense volatility, make it challenging for investors to forecast a price.,Some analysts think bitcoin will retain a premium as a security, like gold, in the digital world, while other cryptocurrencies are used for commerce.,Others see it as just another asset.,“One of the reasons to own cryptocurrencies is because they are an effective hedge,” said Sam Doctor, a data analyst at New York-based Fundstrat, a research firm whose founder is a well-known bitcoin bull predicting large rises this year. “Until something happens to disprove that thesis, you aren’t looking to sell them so long as other asset classes are falling.”",https://www.dawn.com/news/1404862/bitcoin-frenzy-settles-down-as-big-players-muscle-into-market,"Bitcoin frenzy settles down as big players muscle into market

It’s difficult to give an exact figure. It will depend, but the loss of some seats is certain,” said Bakawan.,“For the Kurds, the city of Kirkuk is not only a source of oil, but also a major population centre in the electoral sense,” Bakawan added.,The loss of Kirkuk is a blow, acknowledged the KDP’s Kuran.,“In contrast to the 2014 elections, there will be no participation in the Kurdish territories outside the autonomous region, in the absence of Kurdish security forces to protect our voters,” he said.,In yet another setback for Kurdish parties, this will be the first time Kurds appear on candidate lists fielded by other ethnic blocs in their home region.,The most striking example is Mustafa Sheikh Kawa, grandson of Sheikh Mahmud Hafid Barzinji, who fought British occupation and set up a Kurdish state between 1920 and 1922.,Kawa is running as a candidate for a bloc led by Shia chief Amar al-Hakim.,“It’s an Iraqi list,” said Saed Hisa Barzinji, an associate of Kawa. “Our aim is to serve the people of Kurdistan.”",https://www.dawn.com/news/1404914/divided-kurds-face-losses-in-iraqs-election,"Divided Kurds face losses in Iraq’s election

The judge was hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by Khubaib Hassan for the recovery of his son Nozair Hassan and daughter-in-law. ,The petition alleged that Mr Hassan, general manager of the National Development Complex (NDC), was abducted along with his wife by unknown people from their G-11/1 residence early on January 12 in front of their children, Hibban, 7, and Safwan, 4. ,On April 11, the court had ordered the Military Intelligence (MI) and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to submit reports.,Petitioner says his son and daughter-in-law were kidnapped by masked men from their G-11 residence on Jan 12,A representative of the ISI on Monday appeared before the court and stated that they neither held the couple nor had any information about their whereabouts. ,However, the counsel for the petitioner contended that being the premier spy agency of the country the ISI should know how the scientist had been abducted. ,He said it was strange that the ISI did not know how a scientist of a sensitive organisation had been abducted along with his wife. ,The counsel argued that as per the defence laws if an employee goes missing the matter required an inquiry within 24 hours followed by an action report to all concerned. The defence ministry should inform the court what it had done in that regard so far. ,Subsequently, the court sought a consolidated report from the spy agencies within two weeks and adjourned the case till a fortnight. ,Mr Hassan’s father through his counsel Inamul Rahim Advocate cited the station house officer (SHO) Ramna, the inspector general of the capital police, Ministry of Defence, ISI and the secretary interior as respondents. ,The petition said a contingent of masked armed men attired in black uniform along with some people in plainclothes trespassed into their residence and searched the house. ,“After causing unexplainable harassment, chaos and confusion the armed men, surely believed to be men belonging to agencies, took along both the detenues 1 and 2 while leaving behind their two kids screaming and crying for their parents.” ,It said the raiding personnel were not accompanied by any woman official and Mr Hussain’s wife was manhandled by the male security men. ,The petition said after hectic efforts a First Information Report (FIR) was lodged with the Ramna police on January 17. ,However, despite the lapse of over three months the police have failed to trace the couple and share any information with the family. ,The petitioner requested the court to direct the respondents to produce his son and daughter-in-law safe and sound before the court.

An official said the finance department had been verbally told about the budget decision but there was nothing on paper so far.,He said a formal approval was likely to be made to the decision later in the week.,However, sources said the government, which had called the assembly’s budget session on May 14, feared presenting the budget over its thin majority in the house.,Official claims finance dept verbally told about decision but formal consent later this week,They said initially, the government was tempted about making block allocations for the some sectors of its choice but it later backed off considering its thin majority in the house.,The PTI’s strength in the 124-member house came to 45 after the party chief, Imran Khan, named 20 party members as ‘sellers’ of votes in the recent Senate polls.,The PTI’s major ally, Jamaat Islami, has eight members in the house but it is likely to leave the government in few days to join the religious parties’ alliance, Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal.,The sources said in case the budget wasn’t passed by the assembly, the provincial government would collapse.,They also said Chief Minister Pervez Khattak had opposed the federal government’s decision to present the next year’s budget in the Council of Common Interest’s meeting on April 24.,“It’s becoming politically untenable for the PTI’s government to present the budget after opposing the federal government on the matter,” a source said. The chief minister’s spokesperson, MPA Shaukat Yousafzai, told Dawn that the government was against presenting the budget but it had decided to present the budget on the insistence of the opposition parties.,He said his party was against the current government presenting the annual development programme for the next fiscal and that it only wanted to present the administrative budget.

"May 01, 2018 11:51am","PESHAWAR: The deaths of three children, who had died in Shaheen Muslim Town following administration of inactivated polio vaccine during the recently held anti-polio drive, created fear and panic among the local people. ,People in the area buried two children on Monday and alleged that vaccination carried out by health workers led to their deaths. They demanded action against those responsible for the deaths of the children. ,However, the health department has brushed aside the impression being created by the residents of Shaheen Muslim Town about deaths of three children.,Atif Rahman, the coordinator of Emergency Polio Centre, told a news conference that preliminary investigation suggested that two of the deaths occurred due to measles and gastroenteritis while the third one was being investigated by a committee, which would present its report within 48 hours.,The injectable vaccination has been administered to children in the high-risk union councils in Peshawar since April 23 to boost up children’s immunity against polio virus in the area. The virus has been in circulation in the area for the past five months. ,The local people claimed that the three children developed complications, which led to their deaths after vaccination. However, authorities concerned said that the matter was being investigated. ,Two children died last night and another on April 27. There was no indication that IPV had caused the deaths.,“The injectable vaccination, which is given to children for two years, was not administrated to one of the deceased, who happened to be one and half month old. Another child, who died at hospital, was treated for diarrhoea and gastroenteritis,” said Mr Rahman. He said that reaction from injection followed within 30 minutes while the children fell ill after hours and days.,He said that inquiry committee would investigate the deaths and would submit a report after which disciplinary action would be taken if anyone was found guilty. ,Mr Rahman told Dawn that IPV was administered to children towards the end of polio eradication effort and they were committed to ensure that vaccination was conducted smoothly and the children stayed safe.,He said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which saw one polio case last year, had not recorded any case in 2018 but still risked the vaccine-preventable childhood ailment because of recent testing of positive samples from Kohat and Bannu districts recently apart from Shaheen Muslim Town, Peshawar where environmental water sample had consistently been positive.,“Even if we don’t have case but virus is looming and vaccination is the only way to protect our children against disabilities. The campaign targeting 200,000 children is being carried out by trained workers and it is a proven fact that either of polio vaccination, oral or injectable, does not cause death,” said Mr Rahman. ,The local health professionals said that the area had sizeable number of refusal cases against vaccination due to misconceptions. They said that linking the deaths of children with immunisation could cause setback to the campaign. ,They also said that people were in the habit of getting compensations from government for deaths caused by dengue fever and they would try to get some monetary assistance for the losses of their near and dear ones in that case too. ,The health department paid Rs500, 000 for each dengue fever-related death in December last year. ,The anti-vaccination efforts by vested groups also propagate that it is an agenda of anti-Muslims to render the Muslims infertile and reduce their population. But such propaganda is losing steam and perpetrators look for occasions to build their case and convince the people to refuse vaccination at the cost of the children’s lives.,The programme is run through government money, loaned from Islamic Development Bank.

He said that frequent changes in the design of the project had given opportunities to the contractors, the ‘cronies’ of the party (PTI) leadership, to exploit the project funds.,JI chief’s adviser seeks SC order for inquiry into CM’s corruption, nepotism,Mr Qazi drew the attention of the Supreme Court chief justice towards the alleged corruption in Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organisation and insisted that the interference of a PTI leader had compelled the Pedo’s management to hire hundreds of officers against huge salary and perks and thus, compromising the department’s performance and financial strength.,He demanded investigation into the PTI government’s Billion Tree Tsunami afforestation project saying it has become controversial due to the false claims and exaggeration on the part of the party leadership.,JI chief’s adviser alleged that hundreds of party activists were given opportunity to make money through fake bills.,“The alleged corruption, nepotism and mismanagement have marred the KP Economic Zones Development and Management Company, which was established to develop special economic zones in the province for industrialisation. Hundreds of the relatives of PTI leadership were hired against huge salary but the performance of the department has so far been nil,” he said, adding that the party’s favourites drew more than Rs500 million in ‘safeties’ alone other than perks.,He said the government spent Rs34 billion on the construction of flood retaining wall along the Kabul River but no quantitative audit of the project was conducted.,“A large part of stones were simply dumped into the river by a ring of the chief minister’s near and dear ones, who were miraculously successful in securing bids,” he said.,Mr Qazi said financial scams had already been reported in the mining and minerals department and that a provincial minister had disclosed the nepotism and corruption of the chief minister in the mining sector. ,He said the chief minister had appointed his nephew, Zarak Khattak, as the executive engineer in the communication and works department in Nowshera district (CM’s hometown) and that most funds were siphoned off under his stewardship. ,He said that KP Ehtesab Commission didn’t act against Mr Khattak and that it had been functioning without head for few years.,He said the KPEC’s director general had resigned after leveling serious allegations against the CM.,When contacted, spokesman for the chief minister Shaukat Ali Yousafzai denied all allegations against Mr Khattak.,He wondered the JI leaders had seeing corruption in development projects after remaining quite satisfied with governance for more than four years.,“Qazi Luqman does not have a political career.

"May 01, 2018 08:44am","			,AS the temperatures rise, election season creeps up on us. Two days after the budget was presented, the dull numbers game had been abandoned on Sunday night for jalsas, guessing games about the people present (another kind of a numbers game) and election promises galore across the country. ,From Karachi to Punjab to Mardan (leaving aside the one namaloom gathering), leaders put their best foot forward and reminded voters why their party was the only option. The PPP reached out to the people of Karachi while Imran Khan wooed the Lahoris. There was an MMA jalsa in Mardan, peopled mostly by bearded men (if the few glimpses on television were an accurate portrayal). However, the limited coverage of the religious alliance gathering simply reflects the unlikelihood of the MMA doing too well in the election. ,On the other hand, the coverage of the PPP in Karachi and the PTI in Lahore was wall to wall and mostly undisturbed by commentary and ads. After all, these were the two main opposition parties leading the charge against the reigning PML-N, as well as shoo-ins for provincial setups in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. ,From Karachi to Punjab to Mardan, leaders put their best foot forward.,But on Sunday night, both Imran Khan and Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari were not simply kicking off their election campaign but also reaching out to Pakistan’s two biggest cities, which for decades had looked elsewhere for leadership and representation — Karachi to the MQM and Lahore to the Muslim League-Nawaz (except for the Q rule from 2002 to 2008).,That both parties are able to do so, has more to do with the MQM and PML-N than the achievements of the PPP and PTI. ,The relentless operations in Karachi and Altaf Hussain’s run-ins with the establishment have weakened the MQM’s hold on the city. And the latest round of infighting within the MQM means the city may once again be ready to vote for others. Hence, the charm offensive by BBZ, who spoke about why the PPP had so far not been able to transform Karachi (the local government was in charge of Karachi, he argued) and how this would now change. Recounting what his party had done for Karachi, he reminded the crowds that his party was not a party of target killers and sector commanders.,Flanked by senior PPP leaders from Sindh (another reminder of how the party, once a zanjeer of the four provinces now has few faces left outside the province), BBZ also spoke of how he belonged to the third generation of Bhuttos in the service of the people and how the PPP had stood up against extremism at a time when few others were willing to do so. The party’s stand on extremism is the one strong message BBZ has consistently flaunted. ,Criticising the MQM, PTI and Imran Khan and even Shahbaz Sharif’s recent promises to the Karachiites, BBZ’s main message was of what he was not rather than what he may stand for. Unfortunately, this is exactly what this young man needs to address. ,Across the country, the PTI laid its claim to takht-i-Lahore. There is little doubt that the party has made inroads into the PML-N’s stronghold of Lahore (the election results of 2013 and nearly every by-election in Punjab since then illustrate this) but the PTI smells victory this time around because of the establishment’s machinations against the League and the disarray in the latter’s ranks. ,The sense of triumph in the PTI’s jalsa was palpable. Perhaps because, while the PPP can only hope to pick up a few seats in Karachi, the PML-N’s weakening gives the PTI hope of a shot at the centre. After all, the road to Islamabad runs through Punjab with its high number of National Assembly seats. ,Indeed, this was Khan’s and the PTI’s celebration of their journey since 1997; the dance of victory as an enemy lay vanquished (so what if the thousand cuts had been inflicted by other forces) and a formal announcement that it was laying claim to the throne. ,Hence, Khan, unlike BBZ, didn’t focus on the city he was he holding the jalsa in. Instead he gave his 11-point agenda. He provided a to-do list — though his speech could have been so much shorter and less ‘rambly’ — from more obvious items such as eradicating corruption to some which are not so frequently mentioned such as creating jobs by encouraging investment and improving the environment for business or boosting tourism.,The PTI’s message is criticised for aiming at the middle class, the party’s original constituency. But whether one likes it or not, it’s a message that resonates in Punjab and even beyond in a way that that of anti-extremism does not. ,Consider a new UNDP report on the youth coming out tomorrow, which lists the eight priorities of the young as: complete studies; get a job; change job; marry; have children; emigrate; buy a house; buy a car. And this list of priorities was compiled by way of having focus groups across the country and compiling the result. In other words, the researchers did not provide the options to the young. The young identified the priorities themselves. Extremism or militancy is not a concern for the young people; economic issues are. Is this why the PTI is seen as a party supported by the youth? ,This is what Khan is tapping into as does the PML-N. The PPP, with its poor governance record and reputation for corruption, just doesn’t appeal to the electorate in Punjab. BBZ needs to understand this and shape his party and his message accordingly.  ,Till he does so, Khan will remain the prime ministerial aspirant who was addressing Lahore but looking beyond the city’s horizons. The PPP, on the other hand, can have no such pretentions. Punjab is beyond its reach, no matter what Asif Ali Zardari says.,This is BBZ’s biggest challenge — drag his party into present-day Punjab, by not just challenging the N as Khan is doing but also coming up with a message as potent as ‘roti, kapra aur makaan’ once was. Till he does so, his party will not make a comeback in Punjab, whether or not he has his father by his side. ",https://www.dawn.com/news/1404921/winning-over-punjab,"Winning over Punjab

However having said this, our focus is on [talented] youngsters as we are looking at the future,” he said.,Justifying the selection committee’s decision of inducting a number of youngsters into national squad for the England and Ireland Tests, Inzamam said, “Whenever promising youngsters are tested in international competitions, we should not be afraid of defeat as this is the part of the game.”,The chief selector also denied the impression that the pool of players in his tenure had been reduced.,He said the decision to send the Pakistan squad to England much earlier before the start of the one-off Test against Ireland (May 11, Dublin) was taken so that the cricketers got appropriate time to adjust well to the playing conditions before the start of the Test matches. Pakistan’s Tests against England will be held from May 24-28 (Lord’s) and June 1-5 (Headingley).,Commenting on Pakistan crumbling to 168 all out in the ongoing four-day tour opener against Kent at Canterbury, the chief selector said the young players “take some time to adjust to hard playing conditions in England”. ,Responding to a query on whether picking just one wicket-keeper in captain Sarfraz Ahmed for the tour of Ireland and England where besides the three Tests Pakistan will also feature in a number of side matches, was the right decision, Inzamam simply said, “We will try to avoid any such bad happening with Sarfraz.”",https://www.dawn.com/news/1404958/young-pakistan-team-can-overpower-england-inzamam,"Young Pakistan team can overpower England: Inzamam

" May 01, 2018","			,MADRID: Despite a 2-1 victory at Bayern Munich in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals, Real Madrid are worried.,Real host Bayern in the second leg on Tuesday, but the European champions have struggled in decisive matches at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium and are wary of more surprises.,“We have to think about the good things that we did in the first leg in Munich and learn from the match against Juventus at home,” said backup Real goalkeeper Kiko Casilla, referring to the 3-1 loss in the quarter-finals.,“If we put all that together and stay focused, we can make history by reaching another final.”,Against Juve, Real won 3-0 in Italy in the first leg. There was a festive atmosphere for the second leg, which was supposed to be a mere formality.,But Real were surprised by Juventus from the start, quickly squandering their advantage by conceding twice in the first half and once after halftime.,The 12-time champions only escaped an embarrassing home elimination thanks to a controversial late penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo.,“What we have to do is go out and try to win the match,” Real coach Zinedine Zidane said. “That’s going to be our goal. We are not going to think too much about anything else. We will try to score as quickly as possible and win the match.”,Real also relinquished their lead against Bayern in the quarter-finals last season, when they also won 2-1 in Munich in the first leg.,A week later, Bayern sent the match into extra time. Ronaldo, who got both goals in the first leg and one in regulation in the second, scored twice in extra time to complete a hat trick and save Madrid from elimination.,“I don’t know how significant the first-leg advantage will be. We know what happened against Juventus and against Bayern last year,” Zidane said.,“We will need a huge performance. We will need to play like never before this year to be able to advance. We are prepared and we are going to give it all we’ve got to make it to the final.”,Sloppy defense was key for Real’s home struggles both against Juve and against Bayern last year. Real didn’t play poorly but couldn’t stop their opponents on the few chances they created. Against Juve, all three goals came when the Real defense failed to clear routine crosses into the area.,Bayern remember last year’s match well.,“I think they were floundering for every cross and for every long ball, so we know what we have to do,” Bayern striker Sandro Wagner said.,The defense could be a problem for Real again on Tuesday as right-back Dani Carvajal is out injured and Zidane has few options to replace him. Youngster Achraf Hakimi is Carvajal’s immediate substitute but he has not impressed this season.,Nacho Fernandez, a central defender who has played at right back on other occasions, is coming off an injury and it’s not clear if he will be available to play.,Zidane said he may consider using forward Lucas Vazquez in defence, as he did after Carvajal had to leave the first leg because of his injury.,Real captain Sergio Ramos, who used to play as a right-back, could also end up on the flank.,“It could be an option,” Ramos said. “I can adapt. It wouldn’t be a problem for me.”,Real are trying to win a third straight European title, and fourth in five seasons. Bayern, five-time European champions, are looking to return to the final after four seasons.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1404955/real-hope-to-avoid-cl-setback-at-home,"Real hope to avoid CL setback at home

"May 01, 2018 11:38am","MELBOURNE: Australian cricket chiefs are still trying to convince reluctant Indian board to play a day-night Test in Adelaide this year after releasing their international playing schedule on Monday. ,Cricket Australia have scheduled the opening Test of the four-Test India series in Adelaide from Dec 6 to 10, with hopes it will be a pink ball match following concept successes against New Zealand, South Africa and England in recent years. ,Australia have won all three day/night Tests against New Zealand, South Africa and England, while India have never played a floodlit match. ,South Africa were initially reluctant to play their 2016 Test under lights at Adelaide, fearing the hosts would have an unfair advantage. The tourists lost by seven wickets. ,Australia believe day-night Test cricket is the future of the sport and perhaps the only way to save the format despite boom television ratings and record crowds. ,But the powerful Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have so far resisted CA’s overtures. ,CA will play a pink-ball Test against Sri Lanka in Brisbane next year, but chief executive James Sutherland said he was still negotiating with India. ,“It is our preference that we play India in a day-night Test match in Adelaide, but we are still working through this detail and hope to have an answer on this in the coming weeks,” he said. ,Sutherland has been pushing hard at International Cricket Council level for the new Test Championship schedule to include day-night Tests, but the powerful BCCI has a big say in outcomes. ,CA confirmed Australia will face South Africa in a one-off Twenty20 International on Queensland’s Gold Coast, while the new Perth Stadium and Canberra’s Manuka Oval will both host Test cricket for the first time. But Hobart misses out. ,The international season starts on Nov 4 with the first of three ODIs against South Africa before the one-off T20 against the Proteas on the Gold Coast, which will be followed by three T20s against India preceding the start of the Test summer. ,“Our men’s international season structure changes slightly this summer, with one-day and T20 international matches against South Africa and India in November,” Sutherland said. ,Adelaide opens the Test series against India for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and second Test will be at the Perth Stadium in Burswood, across the Swan river from the city’s traditional Test venue, the WACA. ,The series then moves back to Melbourne and Sydney for the traditional Boxing Day and New Year’s showpiece games. ,The Gabba in Brisbane, which usually hosts the first Test of the Australian summer, has been relegated to the Jan 24-28 series-opener against Sri Lanka, who will tour the country for the first time in six years. ,Canberra’s Manuka Oval will then host its first Test match from Feb 1 when the home side meets Sri Lanka in their second and final fixture. ,India’s tour will kick off with a three-match Twenty20 International series in November after Australia start the home summer with four limited overs matches against South Africa. ,The hosts will also play India in three ODIs in January. ,The schedule, which will see Test cricket played in February for the first time in over 20 years, has been structured to avoid clashing with the domestic ‘Big Bash’ T20 competition, which has proved a bigger drawcard for local fans than some Test matches in recent seasons. ,“This will be a win for fans, with reduced overlap with the Big Bash,” Sutherland said. ,Australian cricket has been in turmoil since a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last month led to 12-month bans for Test captain Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. ,The sanctions mean Australia’s two leading batsmen will be unavailable for selection for the home summer. , , ,Oct 31: vs PM XI (Canberra). ,Nov 4: First ODI (Perth Stadium). ,Nov 9: Second ODI (Adelaide). ,Nov 11: Third ODI (Hobart). ,Nov 17: One-off T20 International (Gold Coast). , ,Nov 21: First T20 International (Brisbane). ,Nov 23: Second T20 International (Melbourne). ,Nov 25: Third T20 International (Sydney). ,Dec 6-10: First Test (Adelaide, D/N). ,Dec 14-18: Second Test (Perth Stadium). ,Dec 26-30: Third Test (Melbourne). ,Jan 3-7: Fourth Test (Sydney). ,Jan 12: First ODI (Sydney). ,Jan 15: Second ODI (Adelaide). ,Jan 18: Third ODI (Melbourne). ,Sri Lanka: ,Jan 24-28: First Test (Brisbane, D/N). ,Feb 1-5: Second Test (Canberra).",https://www.dawn.com/news/1404950/bcci-resists-cas-overtures-for-adelaide-day-night-test,"BCCI resists CA’s overtures for Adelaide day-night Test

Khowaja has expressed these apprehensions in a letter he recently wrote to the Sindh government, according to senior police officers.,The SHC in its judgement on petitions of civil society organisations had called for ensuring “autonomy of command and operational independence of police”.,The SHC had also directed the Sindh cabinet to promulgate a new Police Act in line with its judgement, which was also upheld by the Supreme Court on March 22, 2018. However, the detailed judgement of the SC is still awaited.,A.D. Khowaja expresses apprehensions in letter to Sindh govt,The IGP in his letter also advised the provincial government to delay the proposed legislation to “benefit from the jurisprudential wisdom and practical guidance” of the apex court in matters related to the reinforcement of the police as an institution and protection of citizens’ fundamental rights.,According to the IGP’s letter, the SHC had also directed the government to notify rules to be proposed by the IGP in the light of the said judgement. However, instead of notifying the rules, the Sindh government has introduced a “new police act”.,The proposed police act “obviously negates the spirit and clear directions of the SHC and SC judgements,” said Mr Khowaja in his letter.,He warned the government that any attempt to violate the principles laid down by the superior courts would prompt further litigation.,Therefore, Mr Khowaja advised the government to “reconsider” the proposed police act and the new law should “reinforce the institutional, legal, structural and administrative foundations of police force”., ,Informed sources told Dawn that recently a meeting was held, which was attended by IGP, all AIGs and DIGs of Sindh, the home and law ministers, in which the police made their recommendations about the proposed police act.,It was pointed out in the police briefing that the proposed police act appeared to be an “attempt to strengthen the political and bureaucratic control over police”.,Besides, the draft act also lacked external democratic and public oversight and community participation in police affairs.,Furthermore, it was stated that the provincial government had prepared the new police act without a “consultation process”.,As per the presentation, insertion of Section 12 in the new police act takes away the administrative authority and operational independence of the office of the IGP.,Moreover, the proposed procedure of posting of IGP was in “violation of the agreement between federal and provincial governments (1993 agreement) as enunciated in the SHC judgment.”,According to the police presentation, the spirit of the SHC judgement regarding the tenure of IGP and other senior police officers has been violated without giving due process through compelling reasons as set in the famous Anita Turab case.,The police leadership in the meeting proposed that instead of adopting the old model of bureaucratic control, the new police act must be based on modern and democratic policing principles, and the spirit of the apex courts’ judgement must be incorporated.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1404975/igp-fears-draft-police-act-may-undermine-spirit-of-shc-sc-judgements,"IGP fears draft police act may undermine spirit of SHC, SC judgements

At the outset, the bench became irked when a deputy attorney general sought more time to file the report. ,Justice Ahmed said that apparently the authorities concerned were taking the court orders lightly and warned that the establishment division secretary would be held accountable if the order was not complied with within two weeks.,The provincial authorities and an apex court-appointed inquiry committee’s head through the reports informed the apex court in December that 12,000 police officials were found involved in misuse of powers and had patchy backgrounds and about the action taken against them.,According to the reports, former provincial police officer of Sindh Ghulam Haider Jamali, former DIG for training Shahab Mazhar Bhalli, former AIG for finance Fida Hussain, SSP Ghulam Azfar Mahesar, Matiari district SP Amjad Ahmed Shaikh and other top-rank officials’ conduct was found illegal.,However, the provincial authorities said that since they could not take action against the police officers above grade 17, their cases were sent to the establishment division for disciplinary proceedings in accordance with the law and service rules., ,Meanwhile, the same bench on Monday dismissed the appeals of around a dozen primary schoolteachers appointed on contract basis.,The appellants, Sadiq Ali and other teachers, moved the apex court against a judgement of the Sindh High Court which declared their appointment illegal.,The counsel for the appellants contended that the teachers were appointed on a contract basis and later they were sacked, adding that there were over 16,000 teachers, appointed on contract basis, but the appellants were singled out and removed from service.

"May 02, 2018 01:59am","KARACHI: After a threadbare discussion and exchange of arguments and counter-arguments by the treasury and opposition benches, the Sindh Assembly on Monday unanimously passed a bill to allow the provincial government to convert the status of two amenity plots in Karachi’s Surjani Town and Numaish areas to utilise them for its mass transit projects.,Originally, Law Minister Zia Lanjar tabled the Karachi Development Authority (Sindh Amendment) Bill, 2018 before the house for introduction and consideration. The bill aimed at amending the Karachi Development Authority Order, 1975.,It sparked a debate when the opposition benches said converting amenity plots through a generic legislation could open floodgates of conversion of amenity plots in the city, many of which had already been illegally converted for residential and commercial purposes in the past and the matter attracted the Sindh High Court to take cognizance of it.,Muttahida Qaumi Movement’s parliamentary party leader Syed Sardar Ahmed said that the amendment was gravely generic, which could expose all the amenity plots to the whims of the government of the day.,Some MPAs say they are receiving death threats from banned outfits,“Take this issue seriously,” said Mr Ahmed. “Or, we’ll see every amenity plot in Karachi housing commercial structures.”,Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s Samar Ali Khan also said the bill was too generic.,Originally, a clause in the bill says: “[The] government may, if it considers that the conversion or utilisation of amenity plot is of public importance and recording the reasons thereof in writing, allow the conversion or utilisation of such amenity plot.”,Another clause reads: “The amenity plots can be converted to other public purposes only for [the] government-sponsored Mass Transit Projects subject to the approval of the government [cabinet].”,Minister Lanjar insisted that the bill had carried no hidden agenda and would not benefit individuals or groups. ,MQM’s Faisal Subzwari said the government should declare which plots it actually wanted to convert for the mass transit project.,Transport Minister Nasir Shah said an elaborate mass transit system was around the corner and there were certain areas where the government had no space available for the projects. He said the bill related to government-funded transport only involving no commercial activity whatsoever.,Opposition Leader Khwaja Izharul Hasan said that the issue was certainly specific and the house should be told about it.,As Mr Lanjar failed to convince the opposition, Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah rose and said that the house had no further time because of the coming budget session. The bill was of huge importance with no mala fide content and merited being passed immediately, he added.,Mr Shah offered the house to suggest and include certain amendments.,Later, Samar Ali Khan and Mohammad Hussain of the joint opposition held talks with Minister Lanjar and after a consensus the bill was amended by keeping conversion of specific plots for the mass transit purpose. ,In the amended bill, the government was allowed to convert two amenity plots — ST Plot-1 in Sector 4, Surjani and KDA Ground, Numaish, for the project., ,In supplementary agenda, Mr Lanjar presented the Sindh Land Tax and Agricultural Income Tax Ordinance, 2000 (Amendment) Bill, 2018.,It omitted the land tax entirely or substituted it with advance agricultural tax in various clauses and sub-clauses.,It changed the rates of tax on total agricultural income by imposing no agricultural tax where the total income does not exceed Rs1.2 million. Earlier, the least tax was five per cent of the income where the total income does not exceed Rs1m.,CM Shah said his government would also amend the rules to ensure that owners having certain acreage should file tax returns.,PTI’s Samar Khan said collection of taxes had been the major issue. MQM’s Sardar Ahmed and Faisal Subzwari also supported the bill, which was passed into law unanimously.,The Sindh Development and Maintenance of Infrastructure Cess (Amendment) Bill, 2017 was also passed unanimously, while the third quarterly budget report till March 31 was laid in the house., ,A number of lawmakers from the opposition benches informed the house that they were getting death threats from some banned militant outfits in case they did not pay them extortion.,MQM’s Sabir Qaimkhani from Hyderabad said certain banned groups were demanding extortion from him and other lawmakers.,MQM’s Kamran Akhtar said he had received threat.

During the same period, 222,409 two-wheelers were registered in rest of the province. ,MQM’s Sumeta Syed, who has defected to the Pak Sarzameen Party, asked why not a single car was registered in the Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas and Benazirabad regions in the two-year period and why only 19 cars were registered in Sukkur and Larkana regions as compared to the huge number of cars registered in Karachi alone.,The minister replied that the people of the province had the right to get their vehicles registered wherever they wanted., ,In his question, MQM legislator Kamran Akhtar asked about the number of imported vehicles registered and the amount of motor vehicle tax collected during 2013, 2014 and 2015.,The minister said that 17,216 imported vehicles were registered in 2013 and over Rs165 million was collected.

"May 01, 2018 10:13am","THE federal government in the 2018-19 fiscal budget unveiled recently made a surprising announcement of building 100 stadiums across the country for the development of sports. However, there has not been a single word from the quarters concerned on how to polish or honour talented athletes.,Currently in Pakistan, players of almost all sports — barring cricket — are facing an uncertain future due to sheer government apathy towards facilitating promising athletes several of whom, past and present, have recorded impressive achievements in their respective discipline at international level. ,Needless to say, there is an acute need for the government to come out with a comprehensive and long-term national sports policy aimed at not only providing best coaching and equipment to the players, but also at protecting their future after retirement.,The main hurdle in the way of sports development in Pakistan is that there is no specific policy on grooming talented athletes and honouring them for their achievements in cut-throat international competitions. ,Numerous such examples have surfaced recently where former sportspersons — some of them renowned for their magnificent achievements during their playing days — are leading life riddled with suffering.,The case of Olympian Mansoor Ahmed, Pakistan’s hockey World Cup-winning goalkeeper, perhaps tops the present list of sportspersons who have been practically abandoned by the authorities concerned. ,Mansoor, whose memorable save in the shootout against the Netherlands helped Pakistan clinch the 1994 World Cup final in Sydney, has been fighting for life due to a heart disease. Presently, he is admitted to a hospital in Karachi.,While the goalkeeper, who remains in critical condition, recently has sought help from the Indian government to arrange his treatment in India, it is time for Pakistan’s authorities concerned to think about the level of indifference they have reached regarding national heroes, particularly after their retirement. Moreover, the goalkeeper, according to a latest media report, has refused an offer made by an institution in the country to treat him citing “Pakistan does not have enough facilities” signifies there is a lot requiring change in our social sector.,Wrestler Inam Butt and weightlifter Nooh Dastgir Butt, who clinched a gold and a bronze medal, respectively at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games held last month have also mentioned the lack of facilities provided to them by the government in the lead-up to the Games. Only personal hard work and self-financing enabled them to earn the medals.,Another such case is of karateka Saadi Abbas who has also made Pakistan proud recently by becoming the first South Asian player to who attain the 10th ranking in the Karate-1 Premier League.,However, to maintain this position or to move further ahead, Saadi needs sponsors. Unfortunately, he missed out on a league in Morocco, mainly because he had no sponsor, which will no doubt affect his 10th ranking in the future. Despite his appeal, the government has not yet given any concrete response to Saadi in this regard.,During the last several years the Punjab government time and again has also been claiming of building hundreds of stadiums and sports complexes. However, hardly it could offer any specific policy for the promotion and development of athletes.,The system of maintaining old and outdated sports infrastructure has also damaged sports in Pakistan. If the scenario remains the same development in the country’s sports in all probability will remain a daydream.,If anyone reads the constitution of the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB), he will find that it is responsible to provide coaches, trainers, infrastructure and other facilities to athletes. However, the annual PSB budget is less than Rs1 billion and a major chunk of even this amount is consumed on meeting administration’s expenses.,Unless athletes are provided with best training, coaching, gear and diet, better-equipped sports infrastructure alone cannot make its contribution for the betterment of sports.,There are media reports that Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi is going to hold a meeting with sports stakeholders in Islamabad during the first week of May. Hopefully, along with other related issues genuine problems faced by the country’s athletes of all disciplines also come under discussion at this meeting.,India, Pakistan’s arch-rival, has made significant progress in sports development during recent years. They have done it by heavily investing on infrastructure as well as facilitating their athletes. No wonder India remained third on the final medals table at the Gold Coast Games. This is a sign that India will emerge as a major force in this year’s Asian Games.,Meanwhile, when contacted for his word on the recent government announcement of building of 100 stadiums, POA president retired Lt Gen Arif Hasan said, “Building stadiums without a coherent infrastructure development plan and policy would be a waste of money and resources. ,“Will they be multi-purpose or single purpose? Have we carried out a census on how many stadiums have been built unto now and what state are they in now? If at all stadiums are built they should, for the time being, built in major cities/provincial capitals only and should be of international standard,” Arif added.,“Instead of stadiums, a greater number of playing grounds should be made available in each ward/union/tehsil/district. These should be close to the schools/colleges etc and those should have grass, watering system and a few men to maintain it. Should have lights so that the facility could be used during hot weather.,“Modern equipment is required to train on.

"May 01, 2018 12:00pm","The , was inaugurated by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi — after going through its share of hiccups — on Tuesday.,The plan to construct a new airport in Islamabad had been conceived just under forty years ago in 1980 but work on the international-standard greenfield airport hit a number of snags and delays over the years. ,			,The Y-shaped airport is located 20 kilometres from Zero Point Islamabad and over 25km from Saddar, Rawalpindi, and is set to be the largest airport in the country, designed to facilitate 15 million passengers annually in the first phase, which will increase to 25m after its expansion.,IIA today saw its first commercial touchdown with Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight PK-300 landing at the new airport at 11:15am. ,			,According to PIA Spokesman Mashood Tajwar, the national flag carrier's second commercial flight PK-301 will take off for Karachi at around 12:30pm.,Strict security measures were in place as PM Abbasi arrived at the airport along with other officials for the ceremony. The inauguration was initially supposed to take place on April 20 but it was delayed until May 3 due to certain technical problems and security issues.,Speaking at the inauguration ceremony, Abbasi lauded the efforts of Sardar Mehtab, Irfan Illahi and Air Marshal Salam and other officials for their efforts to complete the airport project.,			,""Nothing is impossible, but this [constructing this airport] seemed like it was,"" the prime minister said. ""But we have managed to complete this project as well."",He further said that although Pakistan's ""liberal, open sky scheme"" has been criticised, the policy has been kept in place because the government believes that the ""passengers should have choices"".,""Aviation is a challenging, dynamic field. It keeps changing rapidly and if we don't change ourselves we will be left behind,"" he stressed.,""It is very easy to criticise and hurl accusations,"" he said, adding that those in government have to deal with challenges unknown to critics.,			,Full flight operations will be shifted to the new airport on May 3. All commercial and VIP flights from Benazir Bhutto International Airport (BBIA) will be moved to the new airport.,International carriers, including Emirates Airlines, Qatar Airways, Thai Airways, China Airlines, Oman Air, Etihad Airways, Saudi Airways, Gulf Air, Kuwait Airways and Turkish Airlines, operate flights to and from Islamabad along with PIA, Shaheen Air and Air Blue.,Prior to the inauguration, the Pakistan Air Force had lent a hand to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for smooth and safe conduct of operations at the new airport.,A C-130 flight with passengers and luggage on board had landed at the newly constructed runway on Friday to assess its instrument landing pattern and the quality of the landing strip.,			,Earlier, PAF aircraft, including the lightweight super Mushshak trainer and Hercules transport aircraft, had also landed at the runway.,For air traffic deconfliction, PAF in consultation with the CAA air traffic controllers has readjusted its flying training areas and routes for smooth approach paths of the new airport.,Moreover, PAF has also established an air traffic control squadron manned by qualified controllers to ensure the smooth air traffic flow at the airport.,			,Reaching a decision over a final name of the airport proved to be a major challenge for the authorities. ,On April 20, former Senate chairman Raza Rabbani, after hearing that that an adviser to the prime minister has announced that Benazir Bhutto International Airport would be named Islamabad International Airport, in a letter , and ""withdraw this uncalled for and inappropriate decision"".,However, the official name of the airport had not been decided until last week after the , that had been proposed by Nawaz Sharif-constituted ministerial committee for Islamabad’s new airport.,Besides a four-level terminal building, two runways, taxiways, apron and two parking bays for wide-body aircraft A-380 have been built. There will also be a cargo terminal, fuel farm, air traffic control complex as well as a fully-functional state-of-the-art firefighting station and modern rescue facilities.,The new airport will have 15 air-conditioned jetways or passenger boarding bridges, 13 remote bays for larger aircraft and 7 remote bays for ATR and other smaller planes, in addition to four cargo bays. ,Of the 15 jetways – two have been specified for the wide-body aircraft A380. The Benazir Bhutto International Airport had no boarding bridges and suffered from a chronically inadequate immigration desk. The small number of immigration officers could not handle the influx of thousands of passengers flying in every day.,The new airport will have five conveyer belts to assist passengers in claiming their luggage and personal belongings after they exit their planes. All 15 bays will have separate lounges to make it easier for travellers to navigate to the correct waiting areas.,At level 1 – there are the international and domestic passengers’ arrival area and collection bays for baggage. Airline offices and the engineering department will also be housed on the first level.,At level II – there are the domestic arrivals and departure lounges, boarding bridges, visitors’ gallery, car parking, and Immigration counters for international passengers.,At level III – there are international and domestic check-ins – baggage drop after check-in security scanning, international immigration departure and other airlines offices.,At level IV – there are state lounges and commercially important persons (CIP) lounges, in addition, a crew briefing hall.,There will be as many as 28 escalators, six service lifts. 24 elevators for passengers have been installed in the terminal building in addition to 4 inclined travellators (moving walkways) and 10 horizontal. ,25 restrooms for passengers have been built in the terminal building, however, there is no facility for transit passengers to deposit their luggage. ,Instead, transit passengers will have to carry their luggage with them while waiting for their connecting flights. The Benazir Bhutto Airport did not have this facility either.,A huge parking area for 2200 to 2500 vehicles has been constructed, in addition to a 175-staff car parking bay. And two parking areas have been allocated for state lounge guests. There are nine exit and entry gates to the airport.,Other amenities include dedicated charging stations for passengers to fuel up their electronic devices. In addition, there are charging boxes for cell-phones that will be operated by high-tech fingerprint recognition systems for keeping the phones safe while they are being charged.,There will also be a mini-cinema for travellers to relax and watch a movie before embarking on their connecting flights, as well as a food court with a children’s play area.,From Islamabad, the airport is connected to the Kashmir Highway, while people in Rawalpindi will be able to access it via the Grand Trunk Road. There is no dedicated public transport available to the airport; however, government authorities have plans to inaugurate a metro-bus service for passengers soon.,Besides all other facilities, 18 water tube-wells and three water dams have been built for the new airport. However, arrangements for the availability of clean drinking water have yet to be finalised.,More than 500 Airport Security Force personnel will be required to be deployed at the new IIA to ensure safety for all passengers.,Security officials, however, have already expressed concern over the existing situation of funnel areas of the new airport which are close to the Motorway where lights could be a security hazard.,Though more than 85 security towers have been built around the airport to ensure that nobody from outside can enter the area, several of the towers lack basic facilities like toilets/washroom, lighting and restrooms.,“No clean water is available to drink at the security towers, and it’s difficult to keep visual contact from the towers to the airport,” a security official – requesting to remain unnamed — lamented speaking of the lapses in security management.,The security staff camp is located 12 kilometres away from the airport which security officials consider a cause for concern. The airport itself lacks proper rescue and evacuation mechanisms.,There are also no alternate routes for VIPs, which according to security officials would have the potential to create traffic bottlenecks as well as security hazards.,“The Benazir Bhutto International Airport was a smaller airport, which meant that security management was not so complicated. Considering the new airport is significantly larger, the security detail needs to be much more comprehensive. Given the fact that the location of the airport is also in an area where there have been reports of miscreant activities, security arrangements are not water-tight” a security official said.,He said at the new airport, security management systems, CCTV, and public address systems have been installed complimented with all-night patrolling. There are two bomb pit facilities each on the departure and international sections of the airport.,Besides the on-site hotel, a flight kitchen, post office facilities and ATMs have yet to be provided to passengers using the new airport. However, the PIA spokesman said that the flight kitchen located at the old Benazir Bhutto International airport, which is more than 30 kilometres away from the new airport will be used for cooking meals, which will be transported in trucks to the new airport.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1404991/nothing-is-impossible-pm-abbasi-inaugurates-islamabad-international-airport,"'Nothing is impossible': PM Abbasi inaugurates Islamabad International Airport

The people recognise you very well."",""You held a rally in Liaquatabad, which is our [MQM's] centre, knowing that you will not be harmed. Why don't you hold such a rally in Lyari?"" Siddiqui challenged the PPP, asking if Bilawal had anything to say about the notorious Lyari gang wars, which he alleged were engineered by the PPP's ""militant wings"". ,Militancy in Karachi has diminished in the years following the launch of a Rangers operation in 2013.

My sister, who was in the car with me, lost her life on that fateful day.,The subsequent professional nursing care that I received  was severely inadequate. Sandbags and neck collars to stabilise the neck were unavailable at hospitals.,Unable to talk after a badly done operation, my main way of communication was by blinking. To get the attention of sleeping nurses, I would often bite on my ventilator tube to stop the oxygen supply and set off the alarm.,Lack of proper paramedic care left me with little chance of any substantial recovery. But subsequent rehab treatment in Aylesbury, England provided me with a ray of hope, with excellent nursing care and accessibility of wheelchair users to all socioeconomic backgrounds helping in my rehabilitation.,I came back to Pakistan with a renewed sense of hope and determination, and tried to not let circumstances dictate my life.,However, it soon became apparent that I would not be able to enjoy the basic comforts of life due to lack of access to buildings for wheelchair users. ,I was routinely inconvenienced in going to school, clinics, weddings, movies, restaurants, stores, banks etc. due to the lack of ramps and lifts for those in a wheelchair.,Far too often, my access was dependent on whether good Samaritans
  and/or staff would help carry me up the steps.,Never mind the fact that being physically lifted each time created a health hazard for me, as I was exposed to further injuries and paralysis.,I spoke out on , and , media about my story, and the importance of making sure access for the differently-abled was included in building plans.,However, without tangible ways to effectuate my goals, the media and the public’s initial enthusiasm naturally waned with time. ,My impatience grew, and recently, I engaged with a civil advocacy law firm to explore this subject.,Much to my surprise, I discovered that the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) had mandatory tailor-made provisions for differently-abled persons in public buildings.,Regulation 6.2.3 of the LDA Building and Zoning Regulations 2007 , that:,Needless to say, this provision has not been implemented by the LDA, nor has it been adopted by commercial/public buildings and apartments.,Most places do not have ramps for wheelchair users. The seldom presence of wheelchair ramps is often an afterthought and, as a result, poorly designed and promoted.  ,I have yet to see a single toilet within the LDA’s jurisdiction (or otherwise) that accommodates “disabled” persons.,A few restaurants in recent times have been generous to build ramps (or have portable ramps) after I highlighted the issue to them.   ,I authored letters to the LDA on behalf of the marginalised wheelchair community, imploring them to implement their own regulations.,After the initial forwarding of my letter to the concerned department for action, there was the predictable lack of correspondence afterwards.,My impatience reached fever pitch, and I was constrained to personally visit the LDA head office in Johar Town, Lahore. ,Upstairs, my colleagues had to speak on my behalf to the officials, and I was left out of meaningful discourse (barring one official coming down to see me later).,While the officials acknowledged the legitimate grievances to my colleagues, they used insubstantial reasons to justify the lack of past and current enforcement.,This included stating that the regulations did not apply to buildings that were made before 2008 (notwithstanding the fact that the regulations were written as applicable to all buildings irrespective of construction date) and that the enforcement required a lot of surveying man-power, which required extensive preparation and time (notwithstanding the fact that the regulations have existed for 10 years).,We exited the building with a semblance of hope and expectation. However, recent communications with the LDA have been met with muffled concern, as they have showcased lack of urgency on their part.,Apart from sending notices to the buildings identified by us, no documentary evidence has been shared to demonstrate substantial overhaul.,This is notwithstanding the fact that it is an open secret that LDA regulations have been violated for the past decade with impunity, with little to no action taken.,I am cautiously optimistic that the LDA will take concrete action in the near future on my rather simple demands.,Access to buildings in a safe and secure manner is a gateway for wheelchair users in their pursuit of life, liberty and happiness.,This does not just impact quadriplegic wheelchair users such as myself, but also other people having to use wheelchairs, such as persons suffering from amputation, arthritis, cerebral palsy, multiple-sclerosis, post-polio syndrome, back disorders and old-age weaknesses.,The state has systematically made wheelchair users feel invisible,
  unwanted and unwelcome as a part of its fabric.,With the continual lack of facilities for wheelchair users to access buildings, we as a marginalised community have been systematically deprived of meaningful access to basic healthcare, education, employment and enjoyment of life.,With lack of enforcement by bodies regulating buildings over the past decade, one would think that the courts of law would be a decent avenue for enforcement of rights.,However, far too often, public interest petitions seeking for enforcement of differently-abled persons’ rights become muddled with various state entities seeking time to respond. ,This ultimately leads to a slow decay of interest in such cases, with little to no progress.,The last ray of hope, for better or worse, is the LDA developing a conscience and acting on its own volition. We, the wheelchair users, are at the LDA’s mercy.,Access for us is not just about putting in ramps, but without ramps, we have no gateway to a meaningful life.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1405003/my-long-quest-for-wheelchair-accessible-buildings-in-lahore,"My long quest for wheelchair accessible buildings in Lahore

"May 01, 2018 08:24am","			,I WAS introduced to the concept of dissent in the 1980s when I overheard a conversation among my father’s friends. They said a group of women had scared Gen Ziaul Haq so much that in a televised address he warned the people not to be misled by these few 200 bourgeois westernised women who were opposing his Islamisation regime. Their half-admiration, and half-amusement at Zia’s fear of women, may well have underestimated the Women’s Action Forum, but the shrewd general and conservatives were right to fear any dissent, however fledgling.,WAF, of which I am a member, went on to spearhead the main opposition to Ziaul Haq’s regime and its discriminatory laws and subsequent military adventures. The point is that dissent is never innocuous, and it should worry the self-serving guardians of the status quo but not those who stand for progress and justice.,Postcolonial scholars and right-wing conservatives oppose enlightenment rights, human rights laws, or modernity for Pakistan and offer religious laws and culture as substitutes. The liberals too, cling on desperately to the compromised heirs of the opportunistic PPP. The defeatist argument is that dissent to achieve equality is too utopian, parochial and ineffective against the powerful establishment, and so, we should just work realistically within the system.,Dissent is the highest form of patriotism.,All three groups miss the point of a new wave of dissent and, therefore, the associated opportunities. Current uprisings in Pakistan confirm that it is not the source, scale or span of dissent that matters but its potential to capture the imagination. It is the depth of subversive promise that makes an idea threatening. It is the unpredictability of causes and the unlikelihood of new subversive actors that creates anxiety and throws the balance of powers off the scale. Usually, these ideas have to do with politics, sex, nation and religion. When dissent speaks in a female voice or with an ethnic minority accent, the anxiety is doubled.,Elected governments are completing their terms. Pulling out the corruption card against them may curb the confidence of the parties but they are resisting and fighting back. This spirit for political autonomy is new and scary, and can no longer be subtle. ,Liberals and conservatives are more agreeable on this electoral independence business. Journalists are risking their lives and careers — not to cover ethnic battlefields but to question civil-military relations.,Judicial activism is likely to be a limited form of heroism. It is not in the Federal Shariat Court but the ordinary courts where judges are weeping over a random post perceived as blasphemous or are offended by the appearance of a heart-shaped Valentine’s Day balloon. Will we even need an FSC if the ordinary courts compete to protect us from moral and political corruption and save Islam? The tension between constitutional rights/freedoms and moral abstractions are untenable and increasing dissent is challenging such contradictions. ,A handful of dissenting bloggers — on the issue of nationalism or religion — trigger anxiety of such overwhelming proportions that one would think they had made constitutional amendments. On the other hand, a law department makes an administrative lapse that would only have meant missing one of the many opportunities to repeat our determined belief in declaring Ahmedis non-Muslims once in five years. Yet, this results in sleepless nights, blood lust, blocked highways and a prescribed witch-hunt.,It was not a glossy Oscar-winning documentary but the defiant Qandeel Baloch who exposed the sham of male honour. She subverted the notion that all victims deserve sympathy because they are always innocent. Instead, Qandeel flaunted her sexual autonomy and represented a post-Zina law moment. Sex is part of national conversations, and sexual harassment is being subverted — from being used as a tool to shame the victim into one that can hold the perpetrator to account. ,Dissent is not betrayal — it is the highest form of patriotism because it wants change within. Dissent is an opportunity for an inclusive conversation rather than fearful rejection. ,Teaching facts rather than fiction about Pakistan’s history, revisiting the ‘war on terror’ agreement and CPEC’s terms and conditions, respecting sexual equality, criticising national leaders, exposing false heroes and seedy celebrities, calling out failed policies … these are all potentially subversive actions. But suppressing information, silencing inquiry and disappearing political activists will only leave wounds untreated. ,Dissent should be considered a form of catharsis towards a more harmonious, consensual future. This can’t be achieved by embracing appeasement or scoring points via blame and slogans. There’s a bitter sweetness in dissent because it’s a painful but peaceful cry of dissatisfaction and demand for change. The sound of dissent is perhaps what was meant in the lyrics of the song by Prince, ‘This is what it sounds like when doves cry’. ",https://www.dawn.com/news/1404927/when-doves-cry,"‘When doves cry’

"May 01, 2018 08:05am","WITHOUT doubt, it is the hard labour of millions of men and women that drives our economy forward. ,However, as a society we have failed to improve the working and living conditions of the masses. While unions are hardly as powerful as they once were, it is also true that the state has ignored workplace safety regulations, with the result that many working men and women have lost their lives in horrific industrial accidents that could have been avoided had safety measures been in place. ,The , (in which it is suspected criminal elements were involved in deliberate arson) and the fire at the Gadani ship-breaking yard in 2016 instantly come to mind. ,These are just some of the major examples; workers across this land have to operate in hazardous workspaces on a daily basis. ,The fact is that people are desperate for work and unscrupulous employers exploit this need by making labourers work in unsafe conditions.,As activists have pointed out, governments — federal and provincial — must make occupational safety and health a priority and ensure that working conditions within their jurisdictions are safe. ,This means, of course, ratifying the requisite ILO conventions and legislating where necessary. But beyond the paperwork, enforcement is needed to ensure that workers are operating in spaces that meet legal health and safety standards. ,What is more, labour courts need to be made more active so that they can adjudicate on cases speedily. ,While the system indeed favours big business and only pays lip service to the working classes, it is time those political parties that swear by progressive and egalitarian ideals put their money where their mouth is: it is election year and parties in their manifestos must clearly enunciate what they intend to do to improve the lot of workers. ,Working people are not asking for much; all they want is dignity and respect, safe workplaces and a better future for their children.

Let the opponents go on with their hundred emotional somersaults. The important thing is to remain sensible, preferably with a smile, while doing your own pirouette, if for no other reason than to keep the rival guessing. ,That’s what Kim Jong-un just did with Donald Trump. The North Korean leader Trump reviled as a nuclear-trigger happy buffoon is being lauded as a potential harbinger of peace in a fraught region of the world. Trump who believes he can discipline anyone with his forbidding military arsenal looks set to lose the mid-term polls for his party. ,Both sides of the Korean Peninsula have heaved a big sigh of relief as has the neighbourhood and beyond. All it took was for the young North Korean leader to ,. The line he crossed is a Cold War relic that has lingered on like the grin of the Cheshire cat, which was the last to vanish. ,The most photographed embrace between the estranged Korean leaders, their globally watched stroll, the watering of a shared tree of blessing and the spontaneous banter, the promise to end nuclear brinkmanship, the resolve to go to the Olympics as a joint team are all stories that have been dreamt and even pondered in South Asia by people in India and Pakistan, together and separately.,There are some obvious similarities and there are very crucial differences between the Korean Peninsula and South Asia. One was divided by the Cold War, the other created by colonialism. A cursory glance at the map would reveal a curious feature. Most countries divided by the Cold War have been reunited. Germany, Vietnam, Yemen come to mind. The Koreas look primed as the next. The fact remains that those divided by colonialism remain estranged, in Africa most notably. Palestine and Ireland are prime examples. ,There are some obvious similarities and some very crucial differences between the Korean Peninsula and South Asia.,One doesn’t have to look too hard to see the obvious similarities and how the Korean situation replicates itself in broad contours in South Asia. For that we need to ignore the historical detail. ,Consider the main similarities that really matter today. Pakistan’s worldview is aligned with China as is North Korea’s, while India looks betrothed to the US-led West not unlike South Korea. The Cold War equation was drastically different in South Asia, when the proverbial boot was on the other foot, when the American and British embassies in Delhi lionised Kashmiri resistance. Today, the main global anchors in South Asia and the Korean Peninsula are almost identical.,We don’t know the essential details of the meeting that took place last week ,. The public face offered a reminder of the 1993 event in Beijing when Narasimha Rao and Li Peng signed the landmark agreement on peace and tranquillity on their borders. Reference to that agreement, handiwork of a typically Chinese draftsmanship, was heard again at the Xi-Modi summit. There was also mention of some kind of cooperation in Afghanistan. ,There is an important event ahead when the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meets in China in June. Indian and Pakistani leaders would be there. But already a far-reaching agreement seems to be in place whereby Indian and Pakistani troops would be for the first time involved in a joint multinational military exercise in Russia to combat terrorism.,The agreement announced by the Indian defence minister masks a philosophy deeper than the fact of sending their troops to a multinational exercise under the aegis of SCO. It is an inescapable fact that both sides would be ,. In other words, they have to first accept that they have a common target, a shared understanding of the foe. That is a formula that seems to go back to the Manmohan Singh and Pervez Musharraf agreement when they decided that their talks would not be derailed by acts of terrorism. Ironies! ,On a larger canvas, the ascendant rulers in Pakistan and India are precisely those that did not want a partition in the first place. But they were vehemently opposed to it not because they believed in inclusive secularism or democracy but because they wanted the entire landmass of India to themselves, one eyeing it as a Muslim empire the other drooling at the prospects of a Hindu hegemony. The RSS and the Jamaat were both opposed to a divided Indian subcontinent and they are both controlling if not directly wielding power in their respective domains today. This is different from the Koreas where both sides that met for a handshake and a landmark photo-op represent the ideas that divided them. To work around those differences is civilised. That is what democracies were meant to do. ,Where there is hope from the Korean Peninsula, there’s not much positive energy trickling through for a South Asian encore. That, however, doesn’t mean there is no need to work for a rapprochement nor that it isn’t doable. Today, Jinnah would be scratching his head with disbelief at the narrow ideas they have imposed on his country to stifle women and random communities. ,Nehru and Gandhi are openly accused of betrayal. It would be news if they weren’t. A few months before his death in 1964, Nehru had said that India wanted a confederation with Pakistan. “But every time we mention it, they get frightened.” ,Consider this: what was so frightening about crossing a demarcation line that nobody on the peninsula saw as terribly helpful? Jinnah saw the need for Pakistan as a last resort. Gandhi accepted it grudgingly. And their admirers don’t see the point even when their dreams are exploding.

"May 01, 2018 09:03pm","Pakistan's bowlers got some overs under their belts as Kent captain Joe Denly made an attractive century on the final day of their tour-opener at Canterbury on Tuesday.,Given both Sunday and Monday's play in this four-day fixture had been washed out without a ball bowled, a draw was always the likeliest result.,And Kent were 209 for four in reply to Pakistan's first-innings 168 when, with no prospect for a win for either side, the players shook hands not long before the scheduled close of 6pm local time. Denly was 113 not out.,Together with opener Sean Dickson (74) he put on 160 for the second wicket, after the pair came together at one for one after the early loss of Daniel Bell-Drummond on Saturday.,Their partnership of 127 was a new Kent record for the second wicket against Pakistan, surpassing the 106 shared by Charles Rowe and Chris Tavare at Canterbury back in 1978.,There was no play before lunch on Tuesday after the ground was flooded by a huge downpour on Monday.
But, after extensive work by the ground staff, the match resumed at 2pm local time under sunny and blue skies.,Kent were then 39 for one, with Dickson 24 not out and former England batsman Denly unbeaten on 12.
Denly was the more fluent of the pair early on Tuesday, cover-driving an elegant four off Mohammad Amir.
The Kent skipper went to his fifty in style with a straight six off leg-spinner Shadab Khan.,Denly, who played alongside Amir for the Karachi Kings in the recent edition of the Twenty20 Pakistan Super League, reached the landmark in 90 balls including six fours and two sixes.,South Africa-born Dickson brought up his fifty in 123 balls when he pulled Hasan Ali for a well-struck four.
But when Dickson was lbw to Shadab it sparked a flurry of wickets.,Kent's 161 for two became 174 for three when the unfortunate Alex Blake had his stumps shattered by a late-swinging yorker from left-arm quick Amir — a delivery that would have accounted for many better batsmen.,Shadad, getting some grip and turn after switching to the Nackington Road End, then bowled Zak Crawley for a duck to leave Kent 175 for four.,But Denly was still there and two superb cover-driven fours in the space of three Amir deliveries saw him to a 169 ball-century that included 13 boundaries and three sixes.,Pakistan next face Northamptonshire in another four-day fixture starting Friday before providing the opposition for Ireland's inaugural Test, in Malahide, from May 11-15.,They then play England in a two-Test series at Lord's (May 24-28) and Headingley (June 1-5).",https://www.dawn.com/news/1405011/kents-skipper-denly-scores-ton-against-pakistan-as-rain-affected-fixture-ends-in-draw,"Kent's skipper Denly scores ton against Pakistan as rain-affected fixture ends in draw

"May 01, 2018 10:11am","			,KABUL: The time after the American invasion was a time of great hope. The golden years. After the darkness of the Taliban rule, Afghanistan finally seemed to be on the road to a better life. But today, fifteen years later, that hope has vanished and life seems to be even harder than before.,I began working as a photographer for , under the Taliban, in 1998.,They hated journalists, so I was always very discreet — I always made sure to put on the traditional shalwar kameez outfit when going outside and I took pictures with a small camera that I hid in a scarf wrapped around my hand.,The Taliban restrictions made it extremely difficult to work — they forbid the photographing of all living things, for example, be they men or animals.,One day I was taking pictures of a line outside a bakery. Life at the time was hard, people were without work, prices were going through the roof. Some Taliban approached me.,“What are you doing?” they demanded.,“Nothing,” I answered. “I’m taking pictures of the bread!” Luckily this was in the age before digital cameras, so they couldn’t check to make sure I was telling the truth.,I rarely put my name on my photos at the time, I just signed them “stringer”, so as not to draw unwanted attention to myself., didn’t really have a bureau here back then, we had a house in the same neighbourhood, Wazir Akbar Khan, that we do today. Special envoys would take turns coming here, and we would regularly go to the frontline on the Shomali Plain, where the Northern Alliance was holding out against the Taliban.,Aside from the BBC, only the three agencies, — ,, , and , — remained in the city. Then in 2000 all of the foreigners were finally chased out and I was left alone to hold down the fort at ,’s bureau. I would phone in information to the Islamabad bureau with a satellite phone.,I watched the September 11 attacks on the BBC, not thinking for a second that there would be possible repercussions for Afghanistan. It was the Islamabad bureau that warned me some days later: “Rumours are that the Americans are going to attack.” ,The bombings began less than a month later, on October 7, targeting the city of Kandahar near the Pakistani border, that the Taliban had made as their capital.,I was in the middle of phoning in the information to Islamabad when I heard the planes over Kabul. The first bombs were dropped near the airport. I didn’t sleep that night, but I couldn’t go outside.,The following morning I headed to the airport in my car. Not far from it, I came across a group of several dozen Taliban fighters, dressed in black.,One of them approached me. “Listen, I’m nice today so I’m not going to kill you, but get out of here right away.” I turned around, drove back and left my car at the office. The city was deserted. I came back with my bike, like an ordinary guy, a scarf wrapped around my hand to hide my camera. I took six photos that day, just six. I ended up sending two of them.,Then one morning, the Taliban were gone, vanishing into thin air. You should have seen it. The streets were filled with people. It was like people were coming out from the shadows into the light of life again.,Colleagues began arriving in droves. , sent a text reporter and a photographer from Moscow right away and before you knew it, there were a dozen of us. Kabul became Journalistan. The office was never empty.,I helped out everybody, be it to find lodging, a car, a fixer, or a best way to get somewhere. My best friend opened the Sultan Guesthouse, the first one in Kabul and asked me to join him in the venture. I should have, he ended up making a fortune! It was incredible to see all those foreigners after all the years of isolation under the Taliban. They came from everywhere, and groups of children would run ahead of them on the streets. ,I remember one young man, holding a dollar, repeating over and over: “It’s the first dollar that I’ve ever held!” It was a time of great hope. The golden years. No fighting in the city. The streets were filled with troops from Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Italy, Turkey. The soldiers would patrol the city on foot, saying hello, relaxed and smiling. I could photograph them as much as I wanted.,You could travel anywhere, south, east, west. Everywhere was safe.,And then in 2004, the Taliban came back. First in the Ghazni province in the southeast. Then in 2005 and 2006, they began to spread out, like a virus.,Then the attacks started in Kabul, targeting places frequented by foreigners.,The party was over.,Today the Taliban are again everywhere and we are stuck in Kabul most of the time. T-Walls, those concrete blocks designed to protect against booby-trapped cars and trucks, have sprouted all over the city. People are no longer friendly towards someone with a camera. Often they become aggressive.,People don’t trust anyone, especially someone working for a foreign news agency — “are you a spy?” they ask.,Fifteen years after the American intervention, the Afghans find themselves without money, without work, just with the Taliban at their doorstep. With the withdrawal of essential Western troops in 2014, many foreigners have left and have been forgotten, as have the billions of dollars poured into this country.,I long for those years, immediately following the arrival of the Americans.,Of course the city has changed a lot since 2001. New buildings have been built, large avenues have replaced tiny streets. The signs of war have all but disappeared — except for the old Darulaman royal palace, you won’t see a ruin in the city. The stores are full and you can find almost anything.,But there is no more hope. Life seems to be even more difficult than under the Taliban because of the insecurity. I don’t dare to take my children for a walk. I have five and they spend their time cooped up inside the house.,Every morning as I go to the office and every evening when I return home, all I think of are cars that can be booby-trapped, or of suicide bombers coming out of a crowd. I can’t take the risk. So we don’t go out.,I remember all too well my friend and colleague Sardar, who was killed with his wife, a daughter and a son while on an outing at a hotel, with only his small son somehow surviving the attack.,I have never felt life to have so little prospects and I don’t see a way out.
