I\u2019m not trying to get anything accomplished. So everyone that\u2019s here from Congress, you should feel right at home.\u201d', u'Lots of the dinner guests, we now know, did not end up feeling right at home as Wolf toed the line between being provocative and being offensive \u2014 a line that comedy, particularly political comedy, routinely blurs. Many of the critical responses to Wolf\u2019s caustic monologue wound up showing the extent to which the joke here truly is on tribal, insular Washington itself, and why cosy media events like Saturday\u2019s dinner are inevitably uncomfortable and better off put to rest.', u'A tour around some of the reactions to Wolf \u2014 whom journalists invited to the dinner to exercise her own ribald form of free speech \u2014 also throws some Trump-era hypocrisies into relief.', u'Dennis Miller, a conservative political comedian and Saturday Night Live veteran, seemed to forget that he\u2019s an occasionally nasty comedian himself when he took to Twitter over the weekend to slam Wolf. Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, was so put off by Wolf\u2019s routine that he and his wife fled the dinner. Fair enough. But the Schlapps weren\u2019t so insulted that they couldn\u2019t continue to partake in the event\u2019s other vaguely swampy festivities. They reportedly showed up at a swanky after-party hosted by NBC at the Art Museum of the Americas.', u'Journalists \u2014 liberal, iconoclastic, free-speaking journalists \u2014 also took to Twitter to criticise Wolf or sympathise with her targets, notably Sanders. Perhaps not surprisingly, the president\u2019s press secretary got some of the most rousing support from veterans of the fourth estate, including Andrea Mitchell.', u'I\u2019m not so sure that Wolf was the \u201cworst\u201d since Don Imus skewered Bill Clinton for his extramarital affairs and Hillary Clinton for her legal problems at a media dinner in Washington back in 1996. Remember Stephen Colbert\u2019s savage roasting of President George W Bush at the Correspondents\u2019 Dinner in 2006? That was pretty brutal (and uncomfortable and funny). How about Seth Meyers teeing up Trump at the 2011 instalment? Tough stuff. And funny. (And maybe the reason Trump hasn\u2019t shown up at the last two dinners.)', u'Sanders is an interesting exhibit in Washington tribalism. She has presided over myriad press conferences in which she has gone out of her way to insult the reporters present, while also accusing the press of \u201cpurposefully misleading the American people\u201d. She also regularly goes to bat for a boss who has described the media as the \u201cenemy of the American people\u201d. Some of Sanders\u2019s supporters in the press complained that Wolf made fun of the press secretary\u2019s looks. I thought that Wolf was making fun of the press secretary\u2019s demeanour and character; that\u2019s a distinction with a difference.', u'In the meantime, it\u2019s worth identifying the real problem with the Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner: journalists enter perilous territory when they take too much pleasure in getting dressed up and going out with the people they write about.', u'The event is firmly part of a certain nostalgic Washington tradition, one that\u2019s rooted in the idea that there\u2019s a shared faith in the fundamental value of fact-based journalism. But there isn\u2019t. And that\u2019s a fact that can\u2019t be obscured by the kind of bland humour for which Wolf\u2019s critics seem to pine.', u'So let\u2019s just stop trying.'], 'link': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1404913/hey-washington-the-jokes-really-on-you', 'heading': u'Hey, Washington, the joke\u2019s really on you\n'}

', u'The relics \u2014 brought to Sri Lanka for the first time in more than a century \u2014 were enshrined, at Mulagandhakuti Vihara in Sarnath, in Uttar Pradesh India.

The various artefacts will be on display, till May 2, at the Temple Trees, the official residence of the Sri Lankan Prime Minister. From May 3 to May 12, the relics will be placed at several temples across the island. ', u'A casket has been specially designed to secure the two most revered relics from India and Pakistan. The relics, enclosed in the silver casket, enshrined in the Vihara, were excavated by Sir John Marshall in 1913-14, near the ancient city of Taxila, (Takshashila). ', u'They were found in a small Buddhist chapel close to the Dharmarajika Stupa in a silver reliquary \u2014 a container for holy relics \u2014 with inscriptions dating back to the year 136 (circa 79AD). The second relic enshrined at Sarnath was found by A. H. Longhurst of the Archaeological Survey of India in 1929 in a large Stupa at Nagarjunakonda in the Guntur District of the then Madras Presidency. The Stupa in which the relic was found is described as the Maha Chetiyaor \u2014 the \u2018Great Stupa\u2019 of the Blessed One. The relics will be displayed \u2014 among other areas \u2014 in the districts of Colombo, Matara, Anuradhapura and Kandy. All displays will be open for the public till May 16. ', u'Buddhism was founded in India, 2600 years ago. It spread across the Indian subcontinent and extended to nearby regions, but lost significance in its birthplace due to the revival of Hindu sects like Shaivism and Vaishnavism. The faith however, thrived in many other regions including far east states like Myanmar, and Thailand. Today, Sri Lanka and Bhutan are the only Buddhist majority countries in the Indian subcontinent.

Bashir Baloch, the well-known folk singer of the city \u2014 he has so far been given 132 awards, including two presidential awards, over his career \u2014 sits gloomily at his residence. There is no one else in the room; just him and his awards. ', u'In his highly conservative area of Killi Deba, situated in the heart of the city, I humbly request him to sing a song of his favourite singer. After some thought, and trying to bring some semblance of a smile on his lips, he agrees to sing one of Lata Mangeshkar\u2019s songs. As he finishes, he tells me: \u201cYou know, I came to know about her at the age of 7, and liked her work so much that I started singing her songs at the age of 11.\u201d', u'In his vicinity, almost everyone knows Bashir Baloch. Had that not been the case, the narrow alleys leading to his impoverished house would be hard to navigate correctly. \u201cI was recently at the Chief Minister House from 11am to 9pm,\u201d he continues. \u201cI was promised a meeting with Chief Minister Abdul Quddus Bizenjo, but unfortunately he was busy the whole day. Finally, I pleaded to be allowed to come back home. He could not take out even five minutes for a meeting with me.\u201d', u'Gone are the days when Bashir Baloch would, besides other programmes, be regularly invited on ', u' and ', u', the state-run TV channel. With the remuneration he received, he supported his family. ', u'But then, explains Baloch writer Waheed Zaheer, the private TV channel boom occurred after the turn of the millennium, followed by the social media revolution. \u201cNow, there are channels after channels, so who will watch Bashir Baloch on ', u', or listen to him on ', u'?\u201d asks Zaheer. \u201cTimes have changed.\u201d ', u'Bashir Baloch has seven children and his eldest daughter is 16. The family lives hand to mouth. There is someone, he says, by the name of Nisar Shahwani who enrolled his children at a school in Deba, and also sends wheat for his family annually. \u201cHad Nisar not stretched out his hand, I would not have been able to even send my children to school,\u201d the singer says. ', u'Besides Balochi and Brahui, he sings in six languages; singing is his life. In Balochistan and elsewhere in the country, Bashir Baloch says he has been respected wherever he has gone. People always know him, he says, and several people he has met in recent times have given him money despite the fact that they themselves were hard up. \u201cWhat I need is some sort of official support from the government, so that I may continue my singing and financially support my family,\u201d he explains. \u201cAs a folk singer, I think I should not be asking for financial assistance. But what else I can do? If this doesn\u2019t happen, I will die from hunger along with the children.\u201d', u'It is said that at the time of the 1965 war between India and Pakistan, singer Madam Noor Jehan boosted the morale of the armed forces, which made her even more popular. \u201cThat is what inspired me, too, as a singer,\u201d says Bashir Baloch. \u201cI did sing those songs of hers with a lot of interest, because Pakistan is my motherland.\u201d ', u'Folk singing is a herculean task. Among thousands, it is said, one folk singer is born. In a stunted society such as ours, they are unfortunately born to suffer endlessly. According to former Balochi Academy chairman Abdul Wahid Bandeeg, all of Balochistan\u2019s folk singers\u2019 story is the same as that of Bashir Baloch. \u201cThere is no end to their economic sufferings,\u201d Bandeeg says.', u'Echoing this claim, Bashir Baloch says he would happily sing, but he has had to finally give up. There are, according to him, some 20 more folk singers in Quetta who are facing the same fate as his, but they are suffering silently. \u201cI am not brave like them,\u201d he says, his eyes brimming with tears. \u201cThey suffer, they sing, and they keep silent. I am shamelessly running from pillar to post for some financial assistance.\u201d'], 'link': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1404844/meet-quettas-beleaguered-folk-singer', 'heading': u'Meet Quetta\u2019s beleaguered folk singer\n'}

Two days after the budget was presented, the dull numbers game had been abandoned on Sunday night for jalsas, guessing games about the people present (another kind of a numbers game) and election promises galore across the country. ', u'From Karachi to Punjab to Mardan (leaving aside the one namaloom gathering), leaders put their best foot forward and reminded voters why their party was the only option. The PPP reached out to the people of Karachi while Imran Khan wooed the Lahoris. There was an MMA jalsa in Mardan, peopled mostly by bearded men (if the few glimpses on television were an accurate portrayal). However, the limited coverage of the religious alliance gathering simply reflects the unlikelihood of the MMA doing too well in the election. ', u'On the other hand, the coverage of the PPP in Karachi and the PTI in Lahore was wall to wall and mostly undisturbed by commentary and ads. After all, these were the two main opposition parties leading the charge against the reigning PML-N, as well as shoo-ins for provincial setups in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. ', u'From Karachi to Punjab to Mardan, leaders put their best foot forward.', u'But on Sunday night, both Imran Khan and Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari were not simply kicking off their election campaign but also reaching out to Pakistan\u2019s two biggest cities, which for decades had looked elsewhere for leadership and representation \u2014 Karachi to the MQM and Lahore to the Muslim League-Nawaz (except for the Q rule from 2002 to 2008).', u'That both parties are able to do so, has more to do with the MQM and PML-N than the achievements of the PPP and PTI. ', u'The relentless operations in Karachi and Altaf Hussain\u2019s run-ins with the establishment have weakened the MQM\u2019s hold on the city. And the latest round of infighting within the MQM means the city may once again be ready to vote for others. Hence, the charm offensive by BBZ, who spoke about why the PPP had so far not been able to transform Karachi (the local government was in charge of Karachi, he argued) and how this would now change. Recounting what his party had done for Karachi, he reminded the crowds that his party was not a party of target killers and sector commanders.', u'Flanked by senior PPP leaders from Sindh (another reminder of how the party, once a zanjeer of the four provinces now has few faces left outside the province), BBZ also spoke of how he belonged to the third generation of Bhuttos in the service of the people and how the PPP had stood up against extremism at a time when few others were willing to do so. The party\u2019s stand on extremism is the one strong message BBZ has consistently flaunted. ', u'Criticising the MQM, PTI and Imran Khan and even Shahbaz Sharif\u2019s recent promises to the Karachiites, BBZ\u2019s main message was of what he was not rather than what he may stand for. Unfortunately, this is exactly what this young man needs to address. ', u'Across the country, the PTI laid its claim to takht-i-Lahore. There is little doubt that the party has made inroads into the PML-N\u2019s stronghold of Lahore (the election results of 2013 and nearly every by-election in Punjab since then illustrate this) but the PTI smells victory this time around because of the establishment\u2019s machinations against the League and the disarray in the latter\u2019s ranks. ', u'The sense of triumph in the PTI\u2019s jalsa was palpable. Perhaps because, while the PPP can only hope to pick up a few seats in Karachi, the PML-N\u2019s weakening gives the PTI hope of a shot at the centre. After all, the road to Islamabad runs through Punjab with its high number of National Assembly seats. ', u'Indeed, this was Khan\u2019s and the PTI\u2019s celebration of their journey since 1997; the dance of victory as an enemy lay vanquished (so what if the thousand cuts had been inflicted by other forces) and a formal announcement that it was laying claim to the throne. ', u'Hence, Khan, unlike BBZ, didn\u2019t focus on the city he was he holding the jalsa in. Instead he gave his 11-point agenda. He provided a to-do list \u2014 though his speech could have been so much shorter and less \u2018rambly\u2019 \u2014 from more obvious items such as eradicating corruption to some which are not so frequently mentioned such as creating jobs by encouraging investment and improving the environment for business or boosting tourism.', u'The PTI\u2019s message is criticised for aiming at the middle class, the party\u2019s original constituency. But whether one likes it or not, it\u2019s a message that resonates in Punjab and even beyond in a way that that of anti-extremism does not. ', u'Consider a new UNDP report on the youth coming out tomorrow, which lists the eight priorities of the young as: complete studies; get a job; change job; marry; have children; emigrate; buy a house; buy a car. And this list of priorities was compiled by way of having focus groups across the country and compiling the result. In other words, the researchers did not provide the options to the young. The young identified the priorities themselves. Extremism or militancy is not a concern for the young people; economic issues are. Is this why the PTI is seen as a party supported by the youth? ', u'This is what Khan is tapping into as does the PML-N. The PPP, with its poor governance record and reputation for corruption, just doesn\u2019t appeal to the electorate in Punjab. BBZ needs to understand this and shape his party and his message accordingly. \xa0', u'Till he does so, Khan will remain the prime ministerial aspirant who was addressing Lahore but looking beyond the city\u2019s horizons. The PPP, on the other hand, can have no such pretentions. Punjab is beyond its reach, no matter what Asif Ali Zardari says.', u'This is BBZ\u2019s biggest challenge \u2014 drag his party into present-day Punjab, by not just challenging the N as Khan is doing but also coming up with a message as potent as \u2018roti, kapra aur makaan\u2019 once was. Till he does so, his party will not make a comeback in Punjab, whether or not he has his father by his side.

{'date': u'May 02, 2018 01:59am', 'text': [u'KARACHI: After a threadbare discussion and exchange of arguments and counter-arguments by the treasury and opposition benches, the Sindh Assembly on Monday unanimously passed a bill to allow the provincial government to convert the status of two amenity plots in Karachi\u2019s Surjani Town and Numaish areas to utilise them for its mass transit projects.', u'Originally, Law Minister Zia Lanjar tabled the Karachi Development Authority (Sindh Amendment) Bill, 2018 before the house for introduction and consideration. The bill aimed at amending the Karachi Development Authority Order, 1975.', u'It sparked a debate when the opposition benches said converting amenity plots through a generic legislation could open floodgates of conversion of amenity plots in the city, many of which had already been illegally converted for residential and commercial purposes in the past and the matter attracted the Sindh High Court to take cognizance of it.', u'Muttahida Qaumi Movement\u2019s parliamentary party leader Syed Sardar Ahmed said that the amendment was gravely generic, which could expose all the amenity plots to the whims of the government of the day.', u'Some MPAs say they are receiving death threats from banned outfits', u'\u201cTake this issue seriously,\u201d said Mr Ahmed. \u201cOr, we\u2019ll see every amenity plot in Karachi housing commercial structures.\u201d', u'Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf\u2019s Samar Ali Khan also said the bill was too generic.', u'Originally, a clause in the bill says: \u201c[The] government may, if it considers that the conversion or utilisation of amenity plot is of public importance and recording the reasons thereof in writing, allow the conversion or utilisation of such amenity plot.\u201d', u'Another clause reads: \u201cThe amenity plots can be converted to other public purposes only for [the] government-sponsored Mass Transit Projects subject to the approval of the government [cabinet].\u201d', u'Minister Lanjar insisted that the bill had carried no hidden agenda and would not benefit individuals or groups. ', u'MQM\u2019s Faisal Subzwari said the government should declare which plots it actually wanted to convert for the mass transit project.', u'Transport Minister Nasir Shah said an elaborate mass transit system was around the corner and there were certain areas where the government had no space available for the projects. He said the bill related to government-funded transport only involving no commercial activity whatsoever.', u'Opposition Leader Khwaja Izharul Hasan said that the issue was certainly specific and the house should be told about it.', u'As Mr Lanjar failed to convince the opposition, Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah rose and said that the house had no further time because of the coming budget session. The bill was of huge importance with no mala fide content and merited being passed immediately, he added.', u'Mr Shah offered the house to suggest and include certain amendments.', u'Later, Samar Ali Khan and Mohammad Hussain of the joint opposition held talks with Minister Lanjar and after a consensus the bill was amended by keeping conversion of specific plots for the mass transit purpose. ', u'In the amended bill, the government was allowed to convert two amenity plots \u2014 ST Plot-1 in Sector 4, Surjani and KDA Ground, Numaish, for the project.', u' ', u'In supplementary agenda, Mr Lanjar presented the Sindh Land Tax and Agricultural Income Tax Ordinance, 2000 (Amendment) Bill, 2018.', u'It omitted the land tax entirely or substituted it with advance agricultural tax in various clauses and sub-clauses.', u'It changed the rates of tax on total agricultural income by imposing no agricultural tax where the total income does not exceed Rs1.2 million. Earlier, the least tax was five per cent of the income where the total income does not exceed Rs1m.', u'CM Shah said his government would also amend the rules to ensure that owners having certain acreage should file tax returns.', u'PTI\u2019s Samar Khan said collection of taxes had been the major issue. MQM\u2019s Sardar Ahmed and Faisal Subzwari also supported the bill, which was passed into law unanimously.', u'The Sindh Development and Maintenance of Infrastructure Cess (Amendment) Bill, 2017 was also passed unanimously, while the third quarterly budget report till March 31 was laid in the house.', u' ', u'A number of lawmakers from the opposition benches informed the house that they were getting death threats from some banned militant outfits in case they did not pay them extortion.', u'MQM\u2019s Sabir Qaimkhani from Hyderabad said certain banned groups were demanding extortion from him and other lawmakers.', u'MQM\u2019s Kamran Akhtar said he had received threat. He said banned Lashkar-i-Jhangvi was sending him threats.', u'Ameer Sheerazi of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz from Thatta also blamed the same group for threatening him and demanding extortion money.', u'Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani asked the legislators to submit details about the threats to the law minister.'], 'link': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1404973/pa-allows-sindh-govt-to-convert-status-of-two-amenity-plots-in-karachi', 'heading': u'PA allows Sindh govt to convert status of two amenity plots in Karachi\n'}

{'date': u'May 01, 2018 10:13am', 'text': [u'THE federal government in the 2018-19 fiscal budget unveiled recently made a surprising announcement of building 100 stadiums across the country for the development of sports. However, there has not been a single word from the quarters concerned on how to polish or honour talented athletes.', u'Currently in Pakistan, players of almost all sports \u2014 barring cricket \u2014 are facing an uncertain future due to sheer government apathy towards facilitating promising athletes several of whom, past and present, have recorded impressive achievements in their respective discipline at international level. ', u'Needless to say, there is an acute need for the government to come out with a comprehensive and long-term national sports policy aimed at not only providing best coaching and equipment to the players, but also at protecting their future after retirement.', u'The main hurdle in the way of sports development in Pakistan is that there is no specific policy on grooming talented athletes and honouring them for their achievements in cut-throat international competitions. ', u'Numerous such examples have surfaced recently where former sportspersons \u2014 some of them renowned for their magnificent achievements during their playing days \u2014 are leading life riddled with suffering.', u'The case of Olympian Mansoor Ahmed, Pakistan\u2019s hockey World Cup-winning goalkeeper, perhaps tops the present list of sportspersons who have been practically abandoned by the authorities concerned. ', u'Mansoor, whose memorable save in the shootout against the Netherlands helped Pakistan clinch the 1994 World Cup final in Sydney, has been fighting for life due to a heart disease. Presently, he is admitted to a hospital in Karachi.', u'While the goalkeeper, who remains in critical condition, recently has sought help from the Indian government to arrange his treatment in India, it is time for Pakistan\u2019s authorities concerned to think about the level of indifference they have reached regarding national heroes, particularly after their retirement. Moreover, the goalkeeper, according to a latest media report, has refused an offer made by an institution in the country to treat him citing \u201cPakistan does not have enough facilities\u201d signifies there is a lot requiring change in our social sector.', u'Wrestler Inam Butt and weightlifter Nooh Dastgir Butt, who clinched a gold and a bronze medal, respectively at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games held last month have also mentioned the lack of facilities provided to them by the government in the lead-up to the Games. Only personal hard work and self-financing enabled them to earn the medals.', u'Another such case is of karateka Saadi Abbas who has also made Pakistan proud recently by becoming the first South Asian player to who attain the 10th ranking in the Karate-1 Premier League.', u'However, to maintain this position or to move further ahead, Saadi needs sponsors. Unfortunately, he missed out on a league in Morocco, mainly because he had no sponsor, which will no doubt affect his 10th ranking in the future. Despite his appeal, the government has not yet given any concrete response to Saadi in this regard.', u'During the last several years the Punjab government time and again has also been claiming of building hundreds of stadiums and sports complexes. However, hardly it could offer any specific policy for the promotion and development of athletes.', u'The system of maintaining old and outdated sports infrastructure has also damaged sports in Pakistan. If the scenario remains the same development in the country\u2019s sports in all probability will remain a daydream.', u'If anyone reads the constitution of the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB), he will find that it is responsible to provide coaches, trainers, infrastructure and other facilities to athletes. However, the annual PSB budget is less than Rs1 billion and a major chunk of even this amount is consumed on meeting administration\u2019s expenses.', u'Unless athletes are provided with best training, coaching, gear and diet, better-equipped sports infrastructure alone cannot make its contribution for the betterment of sports.', u'There are media reports that Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi is going to hold a meeting with sports stakeholders in Islamabad during the first week of May. Hopefully, along with other related issues genuine problems faced by the country\u2019s athletes of all disciplines also come under discussion at this meeting.', u'India, Pakistan\u2019s arch-rival, has made significant progress in sports development during recent years. They have done it by heavily investing on infrastructure as well as facilitating their athletes. No wonder India remained third on the final medals table at the Gold Coast Games. This is a sign that India will emerge as a major force in this year\u2019s Asian Games.', u'Meanwhile, when contacted for his word on the recent government announcement of building of 100 stadiums, POA president retired Lt Gen Arif Hasan said, \u201cBuilding stadiums without a coherent infrastructure development plan and policy would be a waste of money and resources. ', u'\u201cWill they be multi-purpose or single purpose? Have we carried out a census on how many stadiums have been built unto now and what state are they in now? If at all stadiums are built they should, for the time being, built in major cities/provincial capitals only and should be of international standard,\u201d Arif added.', u'\u201cInstead of stadiums, a greater number of playing grounds should be made available in each ward/union/tehsil/district. These should be close to the schools/colleges etc and those should have grass, watering system and a few men to maintain it. Should have lights so that the facility could be used during hot weather.', u'\u201cModern equipment is required to train on. Our weightlifters could have performed even better [on Gold coast] had they been trained on latest equipment, and nutrition is also a key aspect,\u201d the POA chief added.'], 'link': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1404976/comment-infrastructure-without-facilitating-athletes-not-to-produce-desired-results', 'heading': u'Comment: Infrastructure without facilitating athletes not to produce desired results\n'}

{'date': u'May 01, 2018 08:24am', 'text': [u'\t\t\t', u'I WAS introduced to the concept of dissent in the 1980s when I overheard a conversation among my father\u2019s friends. They said a group of women had scared Gen Ziaul Haq so much that in a televised address he warned the people not to be misled by these few 200 bourgeois westernised women who were opposing his Islamisation regime. Their half-admiration, and half-amusement at Zia\u2019s fear of women, may well have underestimated the Women\u2019s Action Forum, but the shrewd general and conservatives were right to fear any dissent, however fledgling.', u'WAF, of which I am a member, went on to spearhead the main opposition to Ziaul Haq\u2019s regime and its discriminatory laws and subsequent military adventures. The point is that dissent is never innocuous, and it should worry the self-serving guardians of the status quo but not those who stand for progress and justice.', u'Postcolonial scholars and right-wing conservatives oppose enlightenment rights, human rights laws, or modernity for Pakistan and offer religious laws and culture as substitutes. The liberals too, cling on desperately to the compromised heirs of the opportunistic PPP. The defeatist argument is that dissent to achieve equality is too utopian, parochial and ineffective against the powerful establishment, and so, we should just work realistically within the system.', u'Dissent is the highest form of patriotism.', u'All three groups miss the point of a new wave of dissent and, therefore, the associated opportunities. Current uprisings in Pakistan confirm that it is not the source, scale or span of dissent that matters but its potential to capture the imagination. It is the depth of subversive promise that makes an idea threatening. It is the unpredictability of causes and the unlikelihood of new subversive actors that creates anxiety and throws the balance of powers off the scale. Usually, these ideas have to do with politics, sex, nation and religion. When dissent speaks in a female voice or with an ethnic minority accent, the anxiety is doubled.', u'Elected governments are completing their terms. Pulling out the corruption card against them may curb the confidence of the parties but they are resisting and fighting back. This spirit for political autonomy is new and scary, and can no longer be subtle. ', u'Liberals and conservatives are more agreeable on this electoral independence business. Journalists are risking their lives and careers \u2014 not to cover ethnic battlefields but to question civil-military relations.', u'Judicial activism is likely to be a limited form of heroism. It is not in the Federal Shariat Court but the ordinary courts where judges are weeping over a random post perceived as blasphemous or are offended by the appearance of a heart-shaped Valentine\u2019s Day balloon. Will we even need an FSC if the ordinary courts compete to protect us from moral and political corruption and save Islam? The tension between constitutional rights/freedoms and moral abstractions are untenable and increasing dissent is challenging such contradictions. ', u'A handful of dissenting bloggers \u2014 on the issue of nationalism or religion \u2014 trigger anxiety of such overwhelming proportions that one would think they had made constitutional amendments. On the other hand, a law department makes an administrative lapse that would only have meant missing one of the many opportunities to repeat our determined belief in declaring Ahmedis non-Muslims once in five years. Yet, this results in sleepless nights, blood lust, blocked highways and a prescribed witch-hunt.', u'It was not a glossy Oscar-winning documentary but the defiant Qandeel Baloch who exposed the sham of male honour. She subverted the notion that all victims deserve sympathy because they are always innocent. Instead, Qandeel flaunted her sexual autonomy and represented a post-Zina law moment. Sex is part of national conversations, and sexual harassment is being subverted \u2014 from being used as a tool to shame the victim into one that can hold the perpetrator to account. ', u'Dissent is not betrayal \u2014 it is the highest form of patriotism because it wants change within. Dissent is an opportunity for an inclusive conversation rather than fearful rejection. ', u'Teaching facts rather than fiction about Pakistan\u2019s history, revisiting the \u2018war on terror\u2019 agreement and CPEC\u2019s terms and conditions, respecting sexual equality, criticising national leaders, exposing false heroes and seedy celebrities, calling out failed policies \u2026 these are all potentially subversive actions. But suppressing information, silencing inquiry and disappearing political activists will only leave wounds untreated. ', u'Dissent should be considered a form of catharsis towards a more harmonious, consensual future. This can\u2019t be achieved by embracing appeasement or scoring points via blame and slogans. There\u2019s a bitter sweetness in dissent because it\u2019s a painful but peaceful cry of dissatisfaction and demand for change. The sound of dissent is perhaps what was meant in the lyrics of the song by Prince, \u2018This is what it sounds like when doves cry\u2019.

The North Korean leader Trump reviled as a nuclear-trigger happy buffoon is being lauded as a potential harbinger of peace in a fraught region of the world. Trump who believes he can discipline anyone with his forbidding military arsenal looks set to lose the mid-term polls for his party. ', u'Both sides of the Korean Peninsula have heaved a big sigh of relief as has the neighbourhood and beyond. All it took was for the young North Korean leader to ', u'. The line he crossed is a Cold War relic that has lingered on like the grin of the Cheshire cat, which was the last to vanish. ', u'The most photographed embrace between the estranged Korean leaders, their globally watched stroll, the watering of a shared tree of blessing and the spontaneous banter, the promise to end nuclear brinkmanship, the resolve to go to the Olympics as a joint team are all stories that have been dreamt and even pondered in South Asia by people in India and Pakistan, together and separately.', u'There are some obvious similarities and there are very crucial differences between the Korean Peninsula and South Asia. One was divided by the Cold War, the other created by colonialism. A cursory glance at the map would reveal a curious feature. Most countries divided by the Cold War have been reunited. Germany, Vietnam, Yemen come to mind. The Koreas look primed as the next. The fact remains that those divided by colonialism remain estranged, in Africa most notably. Palestine and Ireland are prime examples. ', u'There are some obvious similarities and some very crucial differences between the Korean Peninsula and South Asia.', u'One doesn\u2019t have to look too hard to see the obvious similarities and how the Korean situation replicates itself in broad contours in South Asia. For that we need to ignore the historical detail. ', u'Consider the main similarities that really matter today. Pakistan\u2019s worldview is aligned with China as is North Korea\u2019s, while India looks betrothed to the US-led West not unlike South Korea. The Cold War equation was drastically different in South Asia, when the proverbial boot was on the other foot, when the American and British embassies in Delhi lionised Kashmiri resistance. Today, the main global anchors in South Asia and the Korean Peninsula are almost identical.', u'We don\u2019t know the essential details of the meeting that took place last week ', u'. The public face offered a reminder of the 1993 event in Beijing when Narasimha Rao and Li Peng signed the landmark agreement on peace and tranquillity on their borders. Reference to that agreement, handiwork of a typically Chinese draftsmanship, was heard again at the Xi-Modi summit. There was also mention of some kind of cooperation in Afghanistan. ', u'There is an important event ahead when the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meets in China in June. Indian and Pakistani leaders would be there. But already a far-reaching agreement seems to be in place whereby Indian and Pakistani troops would be for the first time involved in a joint multinational military exercise in Russia to combat terrorism.', u'The agreement announced by the Indian defence minister masks a philosophy deeper than the fact of sending their troops to a multinational exercise under the aegis of SCO. It is an inescapable fact that both sides would be ', u'. In other words, they have to first accept that they have a common target, a shared understanding of the foe. That is a formula that seems to go back to the Manmohan Singh and Pervez Musharraf agreement when they decided that their talks would not be derailed by acts of terrorism. Ironies! ', u'On a larger canvas, the ascendant rulers in Pakistan and India are precisely those that did not want a partition in the first place. But they were vehemently opposed to it not because they believed in inclusive secularism or democracy but because they wanted the entire landmass of India to themselves, one eyeing it as a Muslim empire the other drooling at the prospects of a Hindu hegemony. The RSS and the Jamaat were both opposed to a divided Indian subcontinent and they are both controlling if not directly wielding power in their respective domains today. This is different from the Koreas where both sides that met for a handshake and a landmark photo-op represent the ideas that divided them. To work around those differences is civilised. That is what democracies were meant to do. ', u'Where there is hope from the Korean Peninsula, there\u2019s not much positive energy trickling through for a South Asian encore. That, however, doesn\u2019t mean there is no need to work for a rapprochement nor that it isn\u2019t doable. Today, Jinnah would be scratching his head with disbelief at the narrow ideas they have imposed on his country to stifle women and random communities. ', u'Nehru and Gandhi are openly accused of betrayal. It would be news if they weren\u2019t. A few months before his death in 1964, Nehru had said that India wanted a confederation with Pakistan. \u201cBut every time we mention it, they get frightened.\u201d ', u'Consider this: what was so frightening about crossing a demarcation line that nobody on the peninsula saw as terribly helpful? Jinnah saw the need for Pakistan as a last resort. Gandhi accepted it grudgingly. And their admirers don\u2019t see the point even when their dreams are exploding.

{'date': u'May 01, 2018 10:11am', 'text': [u'\t\t\t', u'KABUL: The time after the American invasion was a time of great hope. The golden years. After the darkness of the Taliban rule, Afghanistan finally seemed to be on the road to a better life. But today, fifteen years later, that hope has vanished and life seems to be even harder than before.', u'I began working as a photographer for ', u' under the Taliban, in 1998.', u'They hated journalists, so I was always very discreet \u2014 I always made sure to put on the traditional shalwar kameez outfit when going outside and I took pictures with a small camera that I hid in a scarf wrapped around my hand.', u'The Taliban restrictions made it extremely difficult to work \u2014 they forbid the photographing of all living things, for example, be they men or animals.', u'One day I was taking pictures of a line outside a bakery. Life at the time was hard, people were without work, prices were going through the roof. Some Taliban approached me.', u'\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d they demanded.', u'\u201cNothing,\u201d I answered. \u201cI\u2019m taking pictures of the bread!\u201d Luckily this was in the age before digital cameras, so they couldn\u2019t check to make sure I was telling the truth.', u'I rarely put my name on my photos at the time, I just signed them \u201cstringer\u201d, so as not to draw unwanted attention to myself.', u' didn\u2019t really have a bureau here back then, we had a house in the same neighbourhood, Wazir Akbar Khan, that we do today. Special envoys would take turns coming here, and we would regularly go to the frontline on the Shomali Plain, where the Northern Alliance was holding out against the Taliban.', u'Aside from the BBC, only the three agencies, \u2014 ', u', ', u' and ', u' \u2014 remained in the city. Then in 2000 all of the foreigners were finally chased out and I was left alone to hold down the fort at ', u'\u2019s bureau. I would phone in information to the Islamabad bureau with a satellite phone.', u'I watched the September 11 attacks on the BBC, not thinking for a second that there would be possible repercussions for Afghanistan. It was the Islamabad bureau that warned me some days later: \u201cRumours are that the Americans are going to attack.\u201d ', u'The bombings began less than a month later, on October 7, targeting the city of Kandahar near the Pakistani border, that the Taliban had made as their capital.', u'I was in the middle of phoning in the information to Islamabad when I heard the planes over Kabul. The first bombs were dropped near the airport. I didn\u2019t sleep that night, but I couldn\u2019t go outside.', u'The following morning I headed to the airport in my car. Not far from it, I came across a group of several dozen Taliban fighters, dressed in black.', u'One of them approached me. \u201cListen, I\u2019m nice today so I\u2019m not going to kill you, but get out of here right away.\u201d I turned around, drove back and left my car at the office. The city was deserted. I came back with my bike, like an ordinary guy, a scarf wrapped around my hand to hide my camera. I took six photos that day, just six. I ended up sending two of them.', u'Then one morning, the Taliban were gone, vanishing into thin air. You should have seen it. The streets were filled with people. It was like people were coming out from the shadows into the light of life again.', u'Colleagues began arriving in droves. ', u' sent a text reporter and a photographer from Moscow right away and before you knew it, there were a dozen of us. Kabul became Journalistan. The office was never empty.', u'I helped out everybody, be it to find lodging, a car, a fixer, or a best way to get somewhere. My best friend opened the Sultan Guesthouse, the first one in Kabul and asked me to join him in the venture. I should have, he ended up making a fortune! It was incredible to see all those foreigners after all the years of isolation under the Taliban. They came from everywhere, and groups of children would run ahead of them on the streets. ', u'I remember one young man, holding a dollar, repeating over and over: \u201cIt\u2019s the first dollar that I\u2019ve ever held!\u201d It was a time of great hope. The golden years. No fighting in the city. The streets were filled with troops from Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Italy, Turkey. The soldiers would patrol the city on foot, saying hello, relaxed and smiling. I could photograph them as much as I wanted.', u'You could travel anywhere, south, east, west. Everywhere was safe.', u'And then in 2004, the Taliban came back. First in the Ghazni province in the southeast. Then in 2005 and 2006, they began to spread out, like a virus.', u'Then the attacks started in Kabul, targeting places frequented by foreigners.', u'The party was over.', u'Today the Taliban are again everywhere and we are stuck in Kabul most of the time. T-Walls, those concrete blocks designed to protect against booby-trapped cars and trucks, have sprouted all over the city. People are no longer friendly towards someone with a camera. Often they become aggressive.', u'People don\u2019t trust anyone, especially someone working for a foreign news agency \u2014 \u201care you a spy?\u201d they ask.', u'Fifteen years after the American intervention, the Afghans find themselves without money, without work, just with the Taliban at their doorstep. With the withdrawal of essential Western troops in 2014, many foreigners have left and have been forgotten, as have the billions of dollars poured into this country.', u'I long for those years, immediately following the arrival of the Americans.', u'Of course the city has changed a lot since 2001. New buildings have been built, large avenues have replaced tiny streets. The signs of war have all but disappeared \u2014 except for the old Darulaman royal palace, you won\u2019t see a ruin in the city. The stores are full and you can find almost anything.', u'But there is no more hope. Life seems to be even more difficult than under the Taliban because of the insecurity. I don\u2019t dare to take my children for a walk. I have five and they spend their time cooped up inside the house.', u'Every morning as I go to the office and every evening when I return home, all I think of are cars that can be booby-trapped, or of suicide bombers coming out of a crowd. I can\u2019t take the risk. So we don\u2019t go out.', u'I remember all too well my friend and colleague Sardar, who was killed with his wife, a daughter and a son while on an outing at a hotel, with only his small son somehow surviving the attack.', u'I have never felt life to have so little prospects and I don\u2019t see a way out. It\u2019s a time of anxiety.'], 'link': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1404893/when-hope-is-gone-shah-marai-in-his-own-words', 'heading': u'When hope is gone \u2014 Shah Marai in his own words\n'}
