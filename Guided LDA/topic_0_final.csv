1,2017-07-01,"Victims’ relatives coerced into accepting blood money, says Davis","			
,WASHINGTON: Raymond Davis, a CIA contractor who shot dead two men in Lahore in January 2011, claims that former ISI chief Shuja Pasha was “clearly committed” to ensuring that the deal for his release was successful. ,In his book The Contractor: How I Landed in a Pakistani Prison and Ignited a Diplomatic Crisis, Davis recalls that Gen Pasha was also “responsible for replacing” the original prosecutor, Asad Manzoor Butt, who was working pro bono at the behest of Jamaat-i-Islami with Raja Irshad, “who was more beholden to ISI than any religious group”. ,Davis explains that the plan to rescue him by paying blood money hinged on the acquiescence of the 18 family members of his victims and “ISI agents applied as much pressure as needed to get them to accept the diyat”. ,With the support of the first prosecutor, several relatives resisted the plan. One of them was Waseem Shamshad, Muhammad Faheem Shamshad’s brother, who “did not come on-board for weeks”. ,Another dissenter was Mashhod-ur-Rehman, a UK-educated lawyer, whose brother had been killed by the SUV that came to rescue Davis. ,“To separate the family members from the radical Islamists whispering in their ears and the lawyer who endorsed a hard-line Islamic agenda, ISI operatives intervened on March 14, 2011, detaining and sequestering all 18 of them,” Davis writes in the book published this week. ,“For the two days preceding the March 16 trial that would decide my fate, Butt (the first lawyer) was unable to reach any of them by phone, and their neighbours confirmed that they had disappeared.” ,The other victim Faizan Haider’s cousin Aijaz Ahmad, who also opposed the deal, complained that “there’s a padlock on their door” and “their phones are all switched off”. ,Davis claims that the night before the March 16 trial, ISI agents took the family members to Kot Lakhpat jail and encouraged them to accept the deal. They were told that if they forgave Davis, they would be given a large sum of money in return. ,If they did not, “the consequences of that decision were made clear the following morning when they were reportedly held at gunpoint just outside the prison’s courtroom for several hours and warned not to say a word about it to the media,” Davis writes. ,“When Butt (the lawyer) arrived at the prison that morning, he received similar treatment. … Butt was never able to see or talk to any of his (now former) clients.” ,Davis says that “the shock of being denied access to the man who’d guided them through their country’s convoluted legal system for more than a month, and forced to agree to a deal that many of them did not want, was evident on their faces as they shuffled to the front of the courtroom on March 16”. ,Carmela Conroy, then US consul general in Lahore, whose name has been mentioned in the book, observed that “the women were indeed the ones taking it the hardest. Some of them had tears in their eyes. Others were sobbing outright”. The new prosecutor, Raja Irshad, presented a signed document to the judge, showing that all 18 legal heirs of the two victims had agreed, at least on paper, to forgive Davis. ,The judge asked the relatives to prove their identity and then gave them $130,000 each for a total of $2.34 million, “the largest amount of blood money ever awarded in Pakistan,” writes Davis. ,After each relative had signed the papers, the judge asked if any of them had been coerced into doing it. 
All 18 relatives said no. The judge also reminded both the defence and the prosecution that they were entitled to object. Neither did. ,Davis identifies himself as a military, not a CIA, contractor who had pledged to defend the United States and its Constitution. He says that before coming to Pakistan, he was part of a team that protected former 
Afghan president Hamid Karzai during his first election campaign. ,At one place in his book Davis says that the two men he shot were robbers, had been arrested more than 50 times on various charges and were carrying stolen mobile phones and unlicensed guns when killed.  ,He says that on Jan 27, 2011, when he killed the two men, he was not on a particular mission. He drove out of his compound in Lahore’s Scotch Corner neighbourhood in a white sedan to survey the “route I would be taking someone on three days later”. His main job was to protect US visitors to the town and to provide protection to diplomats and US officials working at the Lahore consulate. ,Davis also says that the visitor he was supposed to protect three days later was on an apparently secret mission, and even during interrogation he made sure that he did not disclose the visitor’s name or the purpose of his or her visit to Lahore."

11,2017-07-03,View from the Courtroom: Davis book brings to light misuse of Qisas and Diyat law,"The recently published memoir of CIA contractor Raymond Davis titled “The Contractor: How I Landed in a Pakistani Prison and Ignited a Diplomatic Crisis” has once again stirred a controversy, bringing into focus the Qisas (retribution) and Diyat (blood money) provisions of Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), 1860. ,The memoir reveals how a mockery of the law was made by none other than officials of a top intelligence agency of the country as well as other people at the helm of affairs. While certain facts about the trial of Raymond Davis in March 2011 were reported at that time, especially about the role of then chief of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Ahmad Shuja Pasha in his release, the memoir cleared how the Qisas and Diyat law was misused. ,The writer explained how the legal heirs of the two persons killed by him, Mohammad Faheem and Faizan Haider, were coerced by the intelligence agency to accept blood money for pardoning him. “To separate the family members from the radical Islamists whispering in their ears and the lawyer who endorsed a hardline Islamist agenda, ISI operatives intervened on March 14, detaining and sequestering all 18 of them (legal heirs). For the two days preceding the March 16 trial that would decide my fate, Butt (lawyer of the legal heirs) was unable to reach to any of them by phone, and their neighbour confirmed that they had disappeared,” he claims. , ,The memoir further revealed: “The night before the March 16 trial, ISI agents took the family members to Kot Lakhpat Jail and encouraged them to accept the deal that was on table. If they agreed to forgive me, they would be given a large sum of money in return. If they didn’t agree, well, the consequences of that decision were made clear the following morning when they were reportedly held on gunpoint just outside the prison’s courtroom for several hours and warned not to say a word about it to the media.” ,When the judge cleared the courtroom of all irrelevant persons, only General Pasha was left inside. “One of the few people allowed to stay behind was General Pasha, who’d been continually texting ambassador Munter, updating him about the court proceedings,” Raymond Davis claims. ,Interestingly, Raymond Davis states that relying on the Qisas and Diyat law was not his first choice as this law was used to provide legal protection to those who had carried out so-called honour killings. “Relying on such a law to secure my freedom wouldn’t have been my first choice. As someone who values the separation of church and state, I found Sharia law repugnant. But, as Carmela (consul general) had made perfectly clear, I really didn’t have a say in the matter.” ,When he was told on March 16, 2011 by the consul general Carmela Conroy that the proceedings were shifted to Shariah law, he was uneasy with it and stated: “I can’t believe they can get away with this. I’m toast, right? They’re going to drag me into this prison’s courtyard and stone me to death, aren’t they?” ,“No, Ray. That’s Qisas. Sharia law also allows for Diyat, which the families of the victims have agreed to accept,” Carmela replied. ,In the memoir, he has also given a brief history of the Qisas and Diyat law. ,It remains a fact that ever since its inception in 1990, the Qisas and Diyat law remains in centre of different controversies because of its misuse specially in cases of honour-related murders or killings by influential people. ,Commonly known as QDO (Qisas and Diyat Ordinance), through it drastic changes were made in Chapter 16 of the PPC to offences affecting human body. Sections 229 to 338 of PPC, related to bodily hurt and murder were repealed and replaced with new provisions, which the then government claimed were in accordance with the Islamic injunctions and a judgment of the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court. ,The law defines Diyat as “compensation specified in section 323 payable to the heirs of the victims.” Similarly, Qisas is defined as “punishment by causing similar hurt at the same part of the body of the convict as he has caused to the victim or by causing his death if he has committed qatl-i-amd in exercise of the right of the victim or a Wali.” ,Initially, these provisions were introduced through the Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance VII of 1990, popularly known as Qisas and Diyat Ordinance, in Oct 1990 by the then president Ghulam Ishaq Khan during the caretaker government headed by prime minister Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi. The ordinance was re-promulgated over 20 times as the constitutional life of an ordinance is four months. Finally, in 1997 during the government of Nawaz Sharif, it became an Act of the Parliament, which covered all offenses against human body and provided for Qisas and Diyat. ,The Federal Shariat Court had in several Shariat petitions declared that the existing provisions of PPC related to murder and bodily hurt were contrary to the Islamic injunctions. The then government had filed an appeal before the Shariat Appellate bench of the Supreme Court, which dismissed the same in July 1989. The Shariat appellate bench made it binding on the government to amend the relevant laws. ,The five-member appellate bench unanimously decided that sections 399 to 388 of PPC 1860 are repugnant to the injunctions of Islam on different grounds. The bench ruled that these provisions did not provide for Qisas in cases of qatl-i-amd (deliberate murder) and jurooh-al-amd (deliberately causing hurt) as was prescribed in the Holy Quran and Sunnah; it did not provide for compromise between the parties on agreed compensation when they make sulh (compromise) in case of qatl and jurh (hurt); it did not exempt a non-pubert and an insane offender from the sentence of death in cases of murder; etc. ,The bench had held that this decision should take effect from March 23, 1990, whereby the provisions referred to by the bench, to the extent they had been held to be repugnant to the injunctions of Islam, should cease to have effect. ,Following the introduction of the Qisas and Diyat law the crimes affecting human body are no longer considered offences against the society or state, but are now considered offences against an individual. Thus, if these individuals so decide, offenders can walk free even after committing heinous crimes like murder. The legal heirs of a deceased have the right to make a compromise with the offender under section 309 and 310. "
12,2017-07-04,NCHR reasons against execution warrants for ‘juvenile offender’,"ISLAMABAD: The National Commission on Human Rights (NCHR) has taken up the case of Muhammad Iqbal, a juvenile offender, and urged authorities to abstain from issuing his execution warrants. ,It is worth mentioning here that Gujrat Jail authorities forwarded requests to issue his ‘black warrant’ to the Lahore High Court on June 30. ,Muhammad Iqbal was just 17 years old when convicted of a fatal shooting in Mandi Bahauddin in 1999. Suspecting he was a juvenile, the prosecution requested that an ossification test be conducted, the results of which confirmed his minority. However, the court announced the death sentence as Juvenile Justice System Ordinance (JJSO), 2000 — which prohibits execution of a juvenile — could not be passed till that time. ,His death sentence was upheld by the Lahore High Court on March 20, 2002 and his appeal subsequently dismissed by the Supreme Court on Sept 11 the same year. ,Muhammad Iqbal was 17 years old when convicted of a fatal shooting in Mandi Bahauddin in 1999,A complaint was filed on Iqbal’s behalf by Justice Project Pakistan (JPP), a human rights organisation that provides legal representation to most vulnerable Pakistani prisoners, on June 23 before the NCHR, which held an urgent inquiry into the matter on Monday. ,Officials from the home and prison departments were present and a letter of proceedings has been issued to the home department secretary, the registrar of the Lahore High Court and the Anti-Terrorism Court, Gujranwala. ,Member of NCHR Chaudhry Muhammad Shafique, while talking to Dawn, said that the commission was concerned about the denial of appropriate relief due to which human rights were violated. ,“So it was decided to accept the application and it has been directed to hold the process of execution as long as proper inquiry is held because it would be violation of Pakistan’s laws,” he said. ,According to a statement issued by the JPP, Iqbal’s trial was conducted two years before the JJSO 2000 was passed. ,It says that after Pakistan ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990, the president of Pakistan issued a notification granting remission to those juvenile offenders whose death sentences had been confirmed prior to the enactment of the JJSO on the basis of an inquiry into their juvenility. ,In fact, Iqbal was listed as one of the prisoners who would benefit from this notification. Despite this, his mercy petition was rejected in March 2016 and he has been on death row for well over half his life. ,As Pakistan prepares to appear before the Human Rights Committee, the monitoring body of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), on July 11, the issuance of execution warrants for a juvenile offender, such as Muhammad Iqbal, will have a detrimental impact on the country’s performance, the statement claims. ,JPP Executive Director Sarah Belal said she welcomed the intervention by the NCHR to prevent the wrongful execution of a juvenile offender. ,“The Pakistan government has previously stated its commitment to enforcing the prohibition against the execution of juveniles before the UN Child Rights Committee, and not issuing Iqbal’s warrant is the right step to that end,” she reminded."

15,2017-07-05,"Decline in street crime recorded during Ramazan in Karachi, official data shows","KARACHI: A comparative analysis of crime pattern during the month of Ramazan over the past three years has revealed that the number of street crime incidents has decreased with an overall drop in major crime incidents owing to the ongoing targeted operations in the city besides other factors. But police officials admitted that much more was needed to be done to improve the situation, it emerged on Tuesday.,The analysis of day-to-day crime, which has been conducted by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of police and Citizens-Police Liaison Committee (CPLC), revealed that no bank was looted in the city during Ramazan. ,Police plan to privatise Madadgar 15 helpline to ‘improve performance’,The officials believed that some efforts such as outsourcing of police’s Madadgar 15 to a ‘third party’ and designating police mobile vans at each police station to respond to emergency calls were under way, but the crucial aspect of tackling street crime by focusing on technology through installation of CCTV cameras at two dozen designated hotspots was yet to materialise. ,The crime record of the three years showed that the number of automobiles snatched during Ramazan was 31 in 2015, 14 in 2016 and 13 this year. Similarly, the number of automobiles stolen during Ramazan was 160 in 2015, 139 in 2016 and 111 this year. Motorbike theft and snatching also dropped over these years. The data revealed that 250 motorbikes were snatched in 2015, 226 the next year and 155 this year. However, the number of motorbike theft cases increased from 1,708 in 2015 to 2,110 in 2016 but reduced this year to 2,018.,Like vehicle snatchings, the number of mobile phone snatchings reduced significantly during the holy month over these years. In all, 1,512 mobile phones were snatched at gunpoint in 2015, 1,060 mobile phones the next year and 772 this year. However, the number of mobile phone thefts increased from 1,230 to 1,437 last year but reduced this year to 1,147.,The data showed that 13 cases of extortion and one case of kidnapping for ransom had been reported during Ramazan two years ago to the CPLC and police. While no kidnapping for ransom case was reported in 2016 and 2017, the number of extortion cases reduced from nine to seven.,As many as 42 people lost their lives in the month of Ramazan in 2015 on account of various factors including street crimes. The number of people killed in the next Ramazan remained exactly the same. However, this year the number of killings dropped to 26.,“These figures of the last three Ramazans in context of street crimes in the CTD database reconciled with the neutral CPLC data that showed decrease in all heads of street crimes in the month of Ramazan,” said CTD chief Additional IGP Dr Sanaullah Abbasi.,However, Dr Abbasi admitted that there could be instances of street crimes which were never reported to police or the CPLC. ,The CTD chief was of the opinion that a decrease in major crimes, including terror attacks, might have positively impacted street crime in the city. He also admitted that street crime was a “cognitive reality” and still there was greater room for improvement.,CPLC chief Zubair Habib told Dawn that the graph of major heads of street crime was on the decline in the metropolis, yet concrete steps were needed to improve the situation. He was of the opinion that one of the factors adversely impacting street crime was shortage of police manpower. ,Mr Habib said the army had recently completed training of around 5,000 to 6,000 newly recruited policemen and hopefully when they would be deployed in the field, the issue of shortage of manpower would be addressed to some extent.,Besides, the CPLC chief said, the police Madadgar 15 helpline would be outsourced to a “private party” to address the complaints of the general public that the police did not respond in a timely manner to their emergency calls. The move was in the final stage as a tender to this effect would be issued soon, he added. ,He said that private persons equipped with modern equipment would attend emergency calls of citizens, but their performance would be monitored both by the CPLC and the police department.,Sindh IGP A.D. Khowaja had promised to dedicate at least 100 vehicles — one vehicle at each police station — to respond to emergency calls of citizens, after the Sindh government had pledged to provide such number of mobile vans to the police department. ,Asked about the installation of CCTV cameras at the hotspots where street crime was rampant, the CPLC chief said that the project was still in the implementation stage."

21,2017-07-06,"Death penalty in Pakistan being used as political tool, researchers say","The death penalty in Pakistan is exceedingly used as a political tool, research conducted by the Justice Project Pakistan has found. Pakistan’s use of the death penalty has failed to deter crime and curb terrorism, it claims.,According to the research, until May 2017, a total of 465 prisoners had been sent to the gallows since Pakistan lifted the moratorium on executions in December 2014. This makes Pakistan the fifth most prolific executioner in the world, following China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, the report says.,Punjab has emerged as the overwhelming practitioner of the death penalty, accounting for 83 per cent of executions, and 89pc of death sentences. However, it has witnessed only a 9.7pc drop in murder rates from 2015-2016. ,Sindh, on the other hand, has viewed a drop of nearly 25pc in murders over the same time period — even though it carried out only 18 executions compared to Punjab’s 382. ,In fact, murder rates in Pakistan were already in decline before the moratorium was lifted, casting even more doubt on the already dubious relationship between the death penalty and reducing crime, the Justice Project says.,Some more facts from the report include:,Pakistan has executed an average of 3.5 prisoners a week since
lifting the moratorium in Dec 2014,Punjab accounts for 83pc of the 465 executions that have taken
place from Dec 2014 – May 2017,Sindh has shown the greatest drop in murder rates, but accounts for
only 4pc of executions,Executions increase noticeably in the weeks following terrorist
attacks in Punjab,In Punjab, as the number of prisoners held beyond prison capacity
increases, so does the number of executions,A closer look at yearly trends of executions shows that Anti-Terrorism Courts (ATC) accounted for only 16pc of executions, the Justice Project says. In 2015, 65 people tried by ATCs were hanged, but that figure dropped to eight from Jan 2016 to May 2017. The majority of death sentences that have been carried out in that time have come from district and sessions courts, which do not have jurisdiction over terrorism cases.,The government has sought to justify lifting the moratorium for all 27 death-eligible crimes by claiming it is necessary to deter terrorist threats to Pakistan. However, data indicates that the government is mostly hanging terrorists through military courts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and through ATCs in Sindh, according to the Justice Project.,Another trend that has emerged is that the number of executions spike in the wake of a terrorist attack, especially in Punjab. This indicates that the use of executions, like the lifting of the moratorium, is often a reactionary step, according to the researchers.,In Punjab, there is another worrying trend that indicates that executions are being used as a means to make room in prisons that are facing overcrowding. Currently, 25 of the 27 prisons in the province house more prisoners than their capacity and the highest number of executions take place in the most overcrowded prisons.,Pakistan heads for its first UN review under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) next week on July 11, which obligates it to uphold and respect the right to life for all its citizens. Pakistan’s return to an executing state has been taken up in the list of issues framed by the Human Rights Council committee.,In just one year after the moratorium was lifted, execution warrants for the mentally ill, physically disabled and juvenile offenders have been issued. More and more cases of wrongful executions have come to light since then. ,In October last year, the Supreme Court acquitted two brothers in Bahawalpur after they spent 11 years on death row, only to find they had already been executed the year before. ,Another prisoner was found innocent a year after he had been found dead in his cell. There are likely many more cases like this, considering a condemned prisoner will spend an average of 11 years on death row, the Justice Project fears.,“Pakistan’s troubling and continued use of the death penalty has continuously fallen short of meeting its international human rights commitments and fair trial standards, as well as our own domestic laws,” says Sarah Belal, executive director of the Justice Project. ,“The death penalty is not an effective tool to curb militancy and crime, as the data clearly shows, yet has been increasingly used for political gain. ,""It is time for the stakeholders to commit to genuine reform in our criminal justice system, and until they do so, to restore the moratorium on the death penalty.”"

24,2017-07-07,Khowaja says taking away powers from police dept inappropriate,"KARACHI: In mild criticism of a recent decision of the provincial government, the Inspector General of Police, Sindh, A.D. Khowaja, said on Thursday that it was not appropriate to take away powers of transfer and posting of SSPs and SPs from the police department.,Speaking at a ceremony of handing over of 351 motorcycles to court moharrirs of the investigation branch and Special Branch personnel at the police headquarters and later talking to the media, the provincial police chief said the Sindh government’s decision to take away powers of transfer and posting of the senior police officers may be “harmful” for the police department.,He said that recently two high-profile undertrial prisoners escaped from the Central Prison Karachi owing to “lack of better security arrangements” there and apprehended that such escaped prisoners presented a danger to society. ,Stresses investigation of criminal cases on modern lines,The police were trying not only to re-arrest such prisoners but efforts were also under way to apprehend the suspects who had targeted six policemen in Bahadurabad and SITE recently.,He said street crime and other crimes had decreased in the metropolis, which was also evident from the data of the Citizens-Police Liaison Committee. He suggested that separate courts be established to try street criminals.,“Crimes would not be reduced till live coverage through a CCTV network [is established],” said the IGP, adding that there were 2,200 CCTV cameras installed in the provincial capital at present though it needed hundreds of thousands of such cameras.,Underlining the importance of investigation of criminal cases on modern lines, the Sindh police chief said: 
“Our focus should be on improving the investigation.” He said all of society suffered the consequences when one criminal was acquitted owing to faulty investigation. He added that there was no supremacy of law because there were problems in investigation. Several problems tended to emerge during investigation of high-profile cases, said Mr Khowaja. Furthermore, the investigation wing of the police also faced financial problems and lacked even basic facilities.,The IGP stressed the need to improve the standard operating procedure of the investigation branch. He said the job of the police was “effective investigation” more than the operational duty.,He said efforts were under way to establish a forensic laboratory, which would provide immense help to the investigators in criminal cases. Besides, he also said that an “explosives laboratory” was being established and hoped that it would be completed in October.,The police chief admitted that the public avoided lodging their complaints about crimes with the force partly because of difficulties in legal process.

25,2017-07-07,‘465 executed since lifting of moratorium on death penalty’,"LAHORE: A data analysis by Justice Project Pakistan (JPP), a non-government organisation working for prisoners’ rights, shows a total of 465 prisoners have been executed since the country lifted moratorium on the executions in December 2014. The organisation regretted that such a high number of the executions has made Pakistan “fifth most prolific executioner” in the world, following China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. ,The research shows the use of death penalty has failed to curb crime, including terrorism, but it is exceedingly used as a political tool, sometimes even as a jail overcrowding solution. Punjab has emerged as a major practitioner of death penalty, accounting for 83 percent of the executions, and 89pc of death sentences in Pakistan. However, it has also witnessed only a 9.7pc drop in murder rate from 2015 to 2016. ,Sindh, on the other hand, has registered a drop of nearly 25pc in the same time period – even though it carried out only 18 executions compared to Punjab’s 382. ,The analysis says murder rate in Pakistan was already in decline before the moratorium was lifted, casting even more doubt on the already dubious relationship between the death penalty and crime reduction. Yearly trends of executions show that anti-terrorism courts accounted for only 16pc of the executions. In 2015, 65 people tried by ATCs were hanged, but only 8 were executed from Jan 2016 to May 2017. A majority of death sentences that have been carried out during the period were handed down by sessions courts, which do not have jurisdiction over terrorism cases. ,The JPP states the government sought to justify lifting of the moratorium for all 27 death-eligible crimes by claiming it is necessary to deter terrorist threat to Pakistan.

48,2017-07-16,Beaten to death,"AFTER days of back and forth over the cause of death of young Akhtar Ali, a post-mortem report has finally been prepared. ,It confirms what the boy’s family had been claiming since the 16-year-old’s body was recovered from the house of his employers in Lahore’s Akbari Gate area: the child was beaten with a blunt weapon, resulting in his death. ,Talking to the media, SSP Investigation Mubashir Maiken on Friday further quoted the post-mortem report as saying that the boy’s body bore old wounds as well as fresh ones. ,Consequently, into the murder FIR that was registered when the case first came to light, the police have now inserted an anti-terrorism clause making reconciliation between the two parties difficult. ,Suspected of the murder is the employer of Ali and his sister for the past four years, Fauzia, daughter of PML-N MPA Shah Jahan. ,There are many aspects to this tragedy that must simultaneously evoke emotions ranging from shock to unbearable sadness. ,One is the sort of poverty and lack of governmental intervention/support that produces large families and forces parents to put their children to work in the first place. ,Recent times have thrown up case after case of such domestic workers — young, unaware of any rights and often cut off from their families — being horribly treated. ,Often, the conditions under which they work are hardly different from slave labour. ,Another is the callousness of society itself, where the issue of child labour and the mistreatment of minors is deeply endemic and there for all to see, yet invisible until death or serious injury occur. ,Most depressingly, not even the potential vanguards of change always have their hands clean — consider how many of the country’s educated families employ children, and in particular, ponder the fact that the politician parent of Ali’s suspected murderer is a member of the National Assembly’s standing committee on labour and human resource. ,In such circumstances, can there be anything other than despair?"

The only ‘crime’ of the accused was that he and the deceased girl had exchanged pictures with each other, he added. ,District public prosecutor Nasir Durrani opposed the grant of bail to the accused and admitted that his name was not mentioned in the FIR, but his mobile phone number was. ,He said that if he was granted bail it would discourage parents to send their children to universities and resultantly they would be deprived of their right to higher education.

62,2017-07-23,London hunts for ways to stop deadly youth stabbings,"LONDON: Nearly one young person a week has been stabbed to death in London so far this year, leaving British authorities hunting for ways to stop the increasing violence.,Twenty-seven people under the age of 25 have been stabbed to death in London since the start of 2017, according to figures from city hall.,The alarming figure is but “the tip of the iceberg”, according to Patrick Green from the Ben Kinsella Trust, an educational organisation set up in memory of a teenage stabbing victim.,Police registered more than 12,100 knife attacks which left 4,400 people injured between April last year and March, the highest figure in five years.,“Many of the victims of stabbing are left with permanent disabilities, permanent scars, and the most awful disability which isn’t reported is the mental trauma,” Green told AFP.,“The fact that you recover doesn’t mean that you return to your normal life,” he added.,In contrast to widely held perceptions, the majority of attacks are unrelated to organised crime. Three out of four cases involve individuals who carry a knife because they believe it will make them feel safer.,“This can be a self-fulfilling prophecy, where young people equip themselves with a knife and in doing so significantly up the ante of their chances of becoming a knife victim,” said Bernard Hogan Howe, the former head of London’s Metropolitan Police who retired last year.,One proposal to cut knife crime was announced on Tuesday by Interior Minister Amber Rudd, who wants to ban the possession of outlawed weapons such as zombie knives — often curved blades inspired by horror films — and knuckledusters on private properties.,As part of a planned consultation on knife crime, the government will also examine whether to extend a ban on possessing a knife in public places and schools to include universities.,London Mayor Sadiq Khan has spearheaded a seven-million-pound programme, which includes schools where knife crime is prevalent being given metal detectors.,In announcing the plans last month, the mayor hit out at government cuts which he said had led to the closure of 30 youth centres that could have stopped young people turning to crime.,“The only way we can truly beat the scourge of knife crime on our streets is by properly funding youth services,” Khan said.,Police have been visiting hundreds of schools as part of their “Operation Sceptre”, involving everything from quizzes on criminal responsibility to self-esteem classes.,The operation to tackle knife crime was launched in July 2015 and also sees officers carry out checks on businesses selling knives, in addition to confiscating weapons sold illegally.,Bins have been left in public places for people to dump any banned weapons without fear of being arrested.,But at the same time, the crackdown is facing an uphill struggle with knife attacks increasing by 24 per cent last year.,Since 2010 the number of police officers in the British capital has been cut by 14pc.,“It would be a naive answer to say that if you cut a significant amount out of an organisation you don’t have any consequences,” said Martin Hewitt, assistant police commissioner.,With funds limited, the police have teamed up with hospitals to collect and share anonymous information on each new attack. The database is intended to help emergency services both prevent and better respond to knife crime.,“Austerity creates a catalyst for change, and hopefully that can be a positive change,” said John Poyton, director of the RedThread charity which addresses youth violence."
63,2017-07-23,Honour killings — The dark side of Hazara,"The lynching of a driver over his alleged illicit relations with a woman in Dera Shawal, a small hamlet which falls in the jurisdiction of Garhi Habibullah police station, Mansehra, on April 22 sparked a nationwide outrage. ,Hazara division has a long history of reported and unreported honour killing cases. ,The gruesome lynching – stoning and clubbing by an angry mob – in Dera Shawal came to light in recent days after its footage went viral on social media where the victim is stripped and put down on ground and a mob doesn’t allow police to shift him to hospital. ,According to details, the villagers were perturbed over the frequent visits of a stranger to one of the 80 houses in the hamlet, apparently to meet a woman. Later, a jirga, held under a local elder, decided to intercept the stranger, identified as Abdul Sattar, when he came out after spending a night at one of the homes in early hours of April 22. ,Three parties, as per jirga decree, intercepted Abdul Sattar and after shooting him, started hurling stones and beating him with sticks. ,“I reached the scene soon after receiving information in the small hours and retrieved Sattar in critical condition, but he succumbed to injuries on way to hospital located 25 kilometers from the crime scene,” Mohammad Yasir, Garhi Habibullah police station SHO, narrated the incident. ,Zareena Bibi, mother of Abdul Sattar, wants prompt dispensation of justice, saying though police had arrested the main suspects, she wanted to see them put to gallows. ,“They chopped a part of my body – my son – in such a cruel way that no one can forget, but I want justice without any delay,” she said. ,District police officer Ahsan Saifullah said that they had arrested three suspects and were in the process to bring back another one who managed to flee the country through Interpol. ,He said that it was surprising to note that none of the family members of the woman was involved in the lynching anyway. ,Dera Shawal is located near Garhi Habibullah, a small town where female social activists set up the first ever women only jirga last year after getting fed up with prejudiced decrees pronounced by local elders in the name of jirga. ,“We have settled 62 cases, mostly related to honour and women, in a friendly environment, but jirgas of men are widely prejudiced in such cases and only favour the influential people and resultantly innocent women, and even men, are being killed on the pretext of honour,” said Ruqia Bibi, the member of women only jirga. ,She said that women were never given a fair trial to defend themselves in male-dominated jirgas or any other such forums, ultimately leading to brutal killings. She said that when only men would sit in a jirga to decide the fate of a woman how it was possible for them to know exactly the sentiments of a woman or her ordeals. ,“I think out-of-court settlement of honour-related issues at jirgas is compounding the already fragile situation in the remote areas of Hazara,” she said. ,Hazara division, including Kohistan, Battagram, Torghar, Mansehra, Abbottabad and Haripur districts, has also witnessed such incidents earlier as five women were allegedly killed in Kohistan merely for clapping on dancing of two men in a marriage ceremony in recent years. The region also witnessed a woman marching stripped in streets by landlords in a village of Haripur in the name of honour. ,In Abbottabad, a girl student was killed in cold blood after fastening her to a seat of wagon last year. The ratio of honour killings, according to social activists, is higher in Hazara than any other division in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. ,Twenty-three people, most of them women, have fallen victim to honour killings in Hazara division last year with Kohistan on top with 17 cases, Abbottabad and Haripur one each and Mansehra and Battagram two each cases. However, Torghar, which is known for such incidents, is not part of these figures. ,The unreported killings on the pretext of honour are said to be much higher compared to reported cases of honour-related killings or cases in the division, particularly in Kohistan and Torghar districts. ,The ratio of honour killings in Konsh and Siren valleys of Mansehra is less than in other far-off valleys in the division, but the number of vani cases is said to be higher in these two valleys. In such cases, mostly minor girls are given to rival parties as vani to settle blood feuds and marriages of choice by couples. ,“If Kohistan is excluded, Hazara is far behind other divisions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in murders related to honour,” claimed Saeed Wazir, the deputy inspector general of police, Hazara range. ,He admitted that police had no mechanism except taking ulema on board to bring this evil practice to an end as awareness was important for this. “I am going to start this noble mission from Kohistan and soon an ulema conference would be organised, seeking their help in ending this social evil of killings in the name of honour,” he said. ,He said that ulema were respected by local people in Hazara and when they would wage a jihad against this evil the lives of people in such largely fabricated cases could be protected. ,“I am going to launch this mission from Kohistan which would gradually be spread to other districts of Hazara,” said Mr Wazir. ,The ulema are also on the same page with police against the killing of women and men in the name of honour and termed this practice contrary to Islamic injunctions. ,Maulana Qudratullah Qadir, a pray leader at the central mosque here, said that sensitising people about Islamic teachings might pave the way for bringing down the current ratio of honour killing cases. ,He said that delay in justice and so-called jirgas were one of the major reasons for unchecked honour-related cases. He said that in many cases men and women were killed to settle enmities."
64,2017-07-23,"10 minors raped, killed in six months in Kasur city","KASUR: Six months and 10 murders, and all the deceased are minor ages five to 10 and all of them were raped and killed. And the bodies were found in under-construction houses. ,An eight-year-old girl was the 10th victim of this serial killing going on in the downtown of Kasur since January this year. ,A-Division police, on July 8, found her body in an under-construction house in Shah Inyat Colony. She had left her house for a street tuition centre when she went missing. The latest victim of the killing spree was a grade three student and the daughter of a domestic help.,Of the 10 minors found raped and killed, seven were girls and three boys. ,After every killing, the public would resort to road protests and disperse after police’s assurance that the case would be resolved soon. ,Police have, however, failed to resolve any case; two persons, which the police said were the alleged rapists, were killed in encounters “by their own accomplices”.,The ‘Husain Khanwala’ incident in which hundreds of children were abused, filmed and, later, blackmailed by local gangs some two years back had already left indelible imprints in the history of Kasur. ,The serial killing started in January this year, when a five-year-old girl, of Kot Peeran, was found gagged in an under-construction house near her house. The police have yet to find any clue in their search for the murderers. ,In February, the body of a minor girl of Ali Park was found in an under-construction house near her residence. ,The 10 killings and all happening in the radius of 10 kilometres have panicked the people.,“I’ve stopped sending my daughters to the tuition centre after the incident,” said Muhammad Akbar, of Shah Inayat Colony. “This is horrible and more terrifying than terrorism.” ,To every killing, the police have responded in a similar fashion: arrest several people in the locality of the crime. ,In the last 12 days, 150 people, including a prayer leader, were taken into custody from different localities. 
In one case, police also took into custody the father and maternal uncles of the deceased girl. A senior citizen requesting anonymity said that A-Division had got a sort of license to pick any one for interrogation. 
He said that it was humiliating for the white collar class to be taken into custody on rape and killing charges. ,A woman of the locality said that police had raided various houses for three nights after the incident and pick up innocent people.,A man, who who was released from police custody a few days back, told Dawn that the lock up was so crammed that he could not sleep for a moment for three days. He said dozens of the people detained in the lock up were all neighbours and had been rounded off for the minor’s killing. He said police kept them shifting from one police station to another only to dodge court bailiffs. The people were detained in A-Division, B-Division, CIA, Ganda Singhwala, Sadar and Mustafabad police stations.,Another man, who was released from police custody last week, told Dawn that police would beat them to get confession. He said their families had to grease the palms of the police officials to secure their release. ,He said that police had not returned his cash confiscated from him before his illegal arrest. He said his area had not only lost a minor girl but also the dignity and honour of dozens of residents. ,“I find it hard to go back to my neighbourhood to face the people after being detained in a rape-cum-killing case,” he sighed. ,Civil society activists dub the entire saga a failure of police investigating. According to them, police have neither trained investigators nor modern investigative tools. Civil society activists would hold demonstration on Sunday to press the local police for the arrest of killers of minors. ,Investigation Superintendent of Police Amjad Mahmood Qurashi, when contacted, said he would call media people to his office to brief on the situation."

74,2017-07-26,Extrajudicial executions in Bangladesh: what goes around comes around,"IN November 2006, in an interview with the US-based National Public Radio, the then law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister Moudud Ahmed, speaking about extrajudicial killings, said: “Although technically you may call it extrajudicial — I will not say killing — but extrajudicial deaths. But these are not killings. According to RAB [Rapid Action Battalion], they say all those who have been killed so far have been killed or dead on encounter or whatever crossfire, whatever you call it — people are happy.”,Little did the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leader know that he would have to take a different stance someday and denounce extrajudicial activities, including killings, torture, and enforced disappearances, at the hands of law enforcement officials! ,Very recently, Moudud made another comment at a discussion on “enforced disappearance, extrajudicial killing, and abduction”, in contrast to his 2006 comment.,He alleged that 118 people were killed extrajudicially and 84 became victims of forced disappearance in the last 10 months. He, however, did not mention the source of the information. But a recent report by the Human Rights Watch (HRW), We Don’t Have Him: Secret Detentions and Enforced Disappearances in Bangladesh, supports Moudud’s claim. ,The Daily Star has also run a news report referring to the HRW report that says security forces in Bangladesh are accused of extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and secret detentions, including that of opposition activists.,According to the HRW report published on July 6: “Human rights organisations and media have documented over 90 people ‘disappeared’ in 2016, of whom 21 were later found dead. The whereabouts of nine remain unknown at the time of writing. The others, after varying periods of secret detention, were ‘released’ before being formally arrested.”,The global rights watchdog in its report also quoted witnesses and family members of the victims as alleging that RAB or the detective branch of police were behind the disappearances.,So what Moudud alleged is not wrong as extrajudicial activities do exist in the country now. At the same time, records of different human rights organisations indicate that this practice has been going on since the creation of RAB in 2004 by Moudud’s party-led government (the then BNP government) following the success of an anti-crime operation named “Operation Clean Heart” in 2002. ,Over the last 10 years, nothing has changed in terms of extrajudicial executions. Bangladesh has a predominant culture of political intolerance between the two major political parties — Bangladesh Awami League and BNP. But at one point, both the parties act alike, using law enforcement agencies to hunt down political opponents. ,Each and every government in Bangladesh has used law enforcement agencies to deal with their political opponents, branding the latter as “criminals”. Therefore, even if a government is replaced by another, the state-sponsored “executions” using law enforcement agencies remain in play.,It’s worth mentioning that, before the last BNP-led government’s tenure expired, then opposition leader Sheikh Hasina, critical of RAB for extrajudicial killings in violation of human rights and the rule of law, in 2006 said: “Many people think if Awami League comes to power again, it will abolish RAB. But we will not do so. Rather, RAB will be given a special assignment to capture corrupt people.” ,Awami League is in power now, but there is apparently no sign of improvement. Between January and June this year, as many as 68 people have been killed in during “encounters” with law enforcement agencies, says human rights organisation Ain o Salish Kendra. In addition, plain-clothes men identifying themselves as security officials picked up 44 people during this period. Seven of them have returned, two bullet-hit bodies were recovered, and three others were shown arrested later. Meanwhile, Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, like his predecessors, brushed aside the allegations brought against the law enforcement agencies in the recent HRW report, and termed it “fabricated” and “motivated”.,Is what Kamal said something new? Since the introduction of anti-crime drive “Operation Clean Heart” in October 2002, no government ministers have taken the blame. They have either justified the actions or trashed the allegations outright. ,It is really shocking to see that the opposition, which raised its voice against the extrajudicial executions, applies the same technique after coming to power. The BNP, which created RAB and used it as a death squad, now loudly calls for holding the RAB officials accountable for their actions. On the other hand, the Awami League, which was critical of its activities while in opposition and promised “zero tolerance” for extrajudicial killings after it came to power in 2009, refuses to acknowledge that some security forces are violating human rights.,From the above discussion, a point can strongly be made that the practice of extrajudicial executions is a politically-motivated decision. We have hardly seen any strong public statements from the subsequent governments to stop this practice, encouraging the law enforcement agencies to feel they are invincible.,This carefree attitude can even turn dangerous. In this regard, researchers Edy Kaufman and Patricia Weiss Fagen observe that when any government heavily relies on police, military, and security forces for silencing dissenting voices, those security forces are likely to “act independently of government control”. The Narayanganj-seven murders or the shooting of Limon are some of the best examples, but they are an exception, too, as the guilty officials were handed down punishment. But in all these years, we have rarely seen any government move to try law enforcement officials for violating human rights. ,Once a staunch supporter of extrajudicial executions, Moudud is now worried as the method is being used by the Awami League-led government against his own party men. Doesn’t the ruling party think that, in case of a democratic change of power, the same technique will be used against its men? The sooner it realises this, the better. What goes around comes around."

78,2017-07-27,Man acquitted in Dr Auj’s murder case for lack of evidence,"KARACHI: An antiterrorism court on Wednesday acquitted a man of killing Prof Dr Shakeel Auj, Karachi University’s Dean of Islamic Studies, for lack of evidence.,Prof Auj was on his way to the Iranian Cultural Centre in Clifton on Sept 18, 2014 when he was shot dead on University Road near Nipa. A student also sustained wounds in the firing, while Professor Dr Tahir Masood of Mass Communication Department, who was travelling in the same vehicle, remained unhurt.,The ATC-VIII judge exonerated the accused person, Mohammad Mansoor, for lack of evidence after recording statements of witnesses and hearing arguments from both sides.,The court observed that the prosecution remained unable to establish its case against the accused beyond a shadow of a doubt, as there were glaring contradictions in the testimonies of witnesses. ,The prosecution had examined around 10 witnesses. It said that the suspect was arrested in January 2015 and alleged that he with his absconding accomplices, Fahim Jabalpuri and Ehtesham, had fired at Prof Auj. ,The charge-sheet said that a 9mm pistol used in the attack was found in a garbage dump near the crime scene on a lead given by the suspect and he was also booked under the Sindh Arms Act, 2013. ,An eyewitness also rightly picked out the accused during an identification parade before a judicial magistrate, it added. However, the defence lawyer argued that the eyewitness was in fact set up as his evidence was shaken during cross-examination before the trial court.,A case was registered under Sections 302 (premeditated murder), 324 (attempt to commit murder) and 34 (common intention) of Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 on a complaint of Dr Hassan Auj, a son of the slain professor, at the Aziz Bhatti police station.,When contacted, the complainant said the acquittal was meant to happen because he, too, believed that Mansoor, said to be a Muttahida Qaumi Movement worker, was not the attacker. ,“It was [done by] those who had been threatening my father for long,” he said, adding that he shared the evidence with the investigators but they did not listen.,“The banned outfits were after my father and there are evidences on record in this regard. I was never satisfied with the investigation.”,The case was plotted against the MQM for ulterior motives, the victim’s son said, claiming that his family were not taken on board or informed about progress in the investigation. ,He appealed to the authorities to take into account the evidences that he had shared with the police to investigate the case accordingly. ,“The Counter-Terrorism Department also held some people belonging to the banned outfit in connection with the murder, but they were never charged with the crime,” he complained.,Soon after the arrest of Mansoor in January 2015, the Karachi police chief Ghulam Qadir Thebo claimed that the suspect was an MQM worker and confessed to his involvement in the murders of Prof Dr Auj and Prof Syed Sibte Jafar.,However, a militant group had claimed the responsibility for the murder in 2014. ,A video message released by Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) a few days after the murder of the professor claimed responsibility for the killing. ,Later, the police too stated that AQIS was behind the killing. "

The trial of such a large number of accused with witnesses and supporters of both sides could result in confrontation between the parties and, thus, a serious law and order situation may arise, he said.  ,The petition stated that a large number of friends and some religious parties had even taken to the streets demanding the release of the arrested students and others involved.,In April, a vigilante mob, incited by rumours attacked Khan for allegedly ""publishing blasphemous content online"". The mass communication student was beaten and shot by the mob and succumbed to the injuries he received.,A report compiled by the 13-member joint investigation team probing the lynching stated that a group in Abdul Wali Khan University (AWKU) incited a mob against the student on pretext of blasphemy.

109,2017-08-07,Women as ‘collateral’ in jirga justice,"RAJA RAM (Multan): The rape of a teenage girl in revenge for a crime committed by her brother has left residents of Raja Ram in central Pakistan shaken and questioning a deeply entrenched system of village justice. ,Last month, a council of village elders ordered the rape of the 16-year-old victim after her brother was accused of raping a 12-year-old girl. ,The ruling highlighted the role such councils – known as panchayats, or jirgas – play in the lives of many rural Pakistanis, who see the country’s courtrooms as a distant presence. ,The councils have traditionally enjoyed broad support, thanks to their ability to offer immediate justice, compared to courts that can take years to settle a criminal case, and as much as a decade to resolve a civil dispute. ,But the recent ruling, which allowed a rape victim’s brother to sexually assault another innocent girl, has unsettled Raja Ram, home to some 3,000 people. ,“May God have mercy, it was such a strange day and it was such a big injustice,” said villager Amina Bibi. ,“In our area there is neither a school nor a hospital, and poverty and ignorance rules here... This incident is a mark of this ignorance,” said 46-year-old Imtiaz Matila. ,“It’s a stain on the name of the panchayat,” agreed another villager, 65-year-old Manzoor Hussain. ,Last month, a council of village elders ordered the rape of the 16-year-old victim after her brother was accused of raping a 12-year-old girl,The girls have since been taken to a women’s shelter in Multan. ,Raja Ram is just a few kilometres down the road, but feels a world away from urban life. ,Men sit around on charpoys, sheltering from the blistering heat, while women are conspicuous only by their absence, shielded from view behind the rough stone walls that surround each of the crudely built, single-storey houses. ,Central Punjab is also home to one of Pakistan’s most prominent advocates for women’s rights – Mukhtar Mai, whose own story offers a window into jirga justice and its brutal mistreatment of women. ,In 2002, a jirga ordered Mai to be gang-raped after her brother was falsely accused of rape. ,Mai, who lives a few hours north of Multan, made the unusual decision to defy her rapists and take them to court. ,But in one of South Asia’s most infamous miscarriages of justice, her attackers walked free, and people continued to rely on panchayats, even as she went on to become a high-profile activist. ,“It’s an honour-based system and there’s nothing more dishonourable than the rape of a woman within your family,” explained women’s rights activist Aisha Sarwari. ,The men of the aggressor’s family must be shamed through the loss of their women’s dignity, Ms Sarwari explained. ,“That’s the balance of power in these communities, which makes sure that women are some kind of collateral.” ,The Supreme Court, trying to bring jirgas to heel, declared them illegal in 2006. ,But in an apparent backtrack this year aimed at unclogging the slow-moving court system the government passed a new law that promotes village councils as an alternative solution to small civil disputes. ,The decision, dubbed the “Jirga Law” by activists, has raised concerns about women’s rights, given the precedents set by the panchayats. ,“The decisions of the jirgas have always had a negative impact on the lives of women,” said women’s rights activist Samar Minallah. ,The new law does not suggest penalties for decisions like the one made by the council in Raja Ram, added Ms Minallah, who brought the original 2006 anti-jirga petition to the Supreme Court. ,But the uproar surrounding the rapes at Raja Ram has spurred the court to demand a full investigation. ,Despite her concerns, Ms Minallah is confident that the court will “step in at one stage or another to remind the state that these jirgas are against the constitution and humanity”. ,Whatever the court decides, for some in Raja Ram at least, faith in the traditional system has been shaken. ,“There used to be wise people in the old days who were making good panchayat decisions,” recalled resident Matila. ,“They used to know the realities of the village... but now, these are the panchayat,” he said, dismissively."

My father died in 2003 and my 70-year-old mother is very worried about my brother. We appeal to the kidnapers to release my brother because he has never been involved in anti-state activities. He only criticised the court’s decision against Nawaz Sharif. He is considered anti-establishment on social media but he has never taken any steps against the establishment,” Mr Malik said.,He urged the chief justice of the Supreme Court and other decision makers to intervene and help in recovering his brother."

128,2017-08-13,Law aimed at helping acid victims remains in limbo,"ISLAMABAD: The Acid and Burn Crime Bill, 2014, which was once cleared for passage by a committee of the lower house but remained pending for over three years, has been deferred once again without being considered by the National Assembly.,Legal experts, however, believe that there is still room for improvement in the bill and suggest that it should be passed as an amendment to the existing law, rather than a new law.,There are certain positive recommendations in the bill, which place an emphasis on the completion of investigation within 60 days, treatment of victim without waiting for police go-ahead, government should bear the cost of the treatment of patient and compensation should be given to victim.,Marvi Memon criticises govt for dragging its feet; legal expert cautions against passing ‘parallel’ laws,PML-N MNA Marvi Memon, who moved the bill on the assembly floor last week, said that this law should be considered the “version 2.0” of legislation that was passed under the previous PPP regime. ,However, she lamented that the PML-N government had dragged its feet on the issue. “It was passed by the committee and sent back to the house, which should have passed it and sent it to the Senate.” But the interior and law divisions did not raise objections at the proper time, she said, criticising her own government for not following the laid down procedures.,She recalled Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy’s Oscar winning documentary on the subject, and said that Pakistan’s efforts were setting an example at the international level. ,While Law Minister Zahid Hamid admitted that there had been a long delay in the examination of the bill by the relevant stakeholders, he asked for the bill to be deferred once again, so that the interior division could have time to examine the bill and make amendments. ,Due to different loopholes in the existing law, activists say, as many as 98pc of cases filed by acid victims are never decided. All stakeholders, including police and doctors need to be trained and more awareness should be given to masses to ensure the implementation of law.,The latest version of the bill suggests that an administrative body, consisting of representatives of police, civil society and human rights organisations etcs should be constituted to oversee cases and. It suggests capital punishment if a victim dies and not less than seven years imprisonment if the victim survives.,Talking to Dawn, legal expert Aftab Alam said that administrative and criminal laws had been combined in this bill.,“I believe this is extra legislation, because in Pakistan the definition of the crime has never been a problem. ,“Problems arise during the implementation phase; the Criminal Law Amendment Act 2011 has already acknowledged acid throwing as a crime and, after that, not only has the number of cases been reduced, the conviction rate has also increased by 10pc,” he said ,“Passing the bill as a parallel law will authorise station house officers (SHO) to register cases under either law, and everyone knows that police often uses the weak sections of law when they want to protect a suspect. Moreover, it is not mentioned in the law if the offense is compoundable or not,” he said.,The latest version of the law directs medical officers to start treating the victim as soon as he/she is brought to the hospital. In the past, medical officers used to wait for police before starting treatment.,It suggests that, as an interim relief, the government will bear the expense of the treatment. Moreover, it says that compensation will be paid to the victim, but the amount is not specified. The condition and financial position of the victim should be taken into consideration while announcing compensation, Mr Alam said.,“An effort has been made to give a timeframe for investigating acid and burn cases, as police have been directed to complete investigation within 60 days. However, these cases will still be tried in normal courts. I suggest that dedicated judges should be deputed for acid burn victims,” he said.,“Another positive thing is that the bill has suggested witness protection measures, but it is left to the desire of the court. I believe that protection should be provided if a witness demands it, because a number of cases are not decided because witnesses refuse to record their testimony or they change their statements,” he said.,Mr Alam said that generally, one investigation officer has to deal with many cases at the same time and are not equipped to investigate cases of acid-throwing, adding that the investigation process had to be modernised.,“The medico-legal report plays an important role in the investigation, but sometimes, acid victims reach the hospital very late. Other times, cases go unreported,” he said.,Giving the example of India, where the government pays compensation to an acid victim, Mr Alam said that the compensation for the acid victim should be part of the law, because the victims suffer throughout their life and should at least be considered equal to a terrorism victim."

133,2017-08-15,SC warns against use of Anti Terrorism Act over ‘non-terrorist actions’,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has cautioned the lower courts to keep ordinary crimes from being pushed into the grey area of terrorism-related cases.,“The courts of law shall not lightly ignore that being a harsh law enacted to punish terrorist or hardcore militant, the Anti Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997 will not be extended liberally to cover criminals who commit the crime of murder or attempted murder for any reason or motive that has no connection with terrorism or militancy,” explained a 22-page judgement authored by Justice Dost Mohammad Khan.,Justice Khan was part of a three-judge Supreme Court bench, headed by Justice Ejaz Afzal Khan, which had taken up an appeal against a May 20, 2009 Lahore High Court verdict dismissing the appeals of six individuals who were convicted of perpetrating a heinous bloodbath on April 24, 2001.,The incident occurred in Chatha police precincts, in the village of Behroop Garh in Gujranwala, where four persons — Nazir Ahmed, Mohammad Saleem, Ghulam Abbas and nine-year-old Sumbal — were killed and nine people, including three children, were seriously wounded.,Cautions lower courts against usurping heirs’ right to qisas by adding ATA sections to murder cases,Police had later added Sections 6 and 7(a) of the ATA, in addition to charges under the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), so that the accused could be tried under the anti-terror law.,Bringing the crime of murder within the ambit of the ATA at random will deprive the legal heirs of the deceased from availing Qisas and Diyat.,In the event of a conviction under the ATA provisions, the fine imposed on the perpetrators went to the public exchequer, defeating the rights recognised by Islamic injunctions for no justifiable reason, the verdict argued.,These rights, Justice Khan wrote, were personal rights of the legal heirs of the deceased person or the victims, which should not be disturbed or taken away by including provisions of the ATA.,When crimes such as murder, attempted murder and theft were not included in the scheme of the ATA, such crimes should not come within the ambit of the ATA if there was no element of terrorism involved, Justice Khan asserted.,Under certain circumstances, the judgement said, if these offences were committed by individuals after a sudden flare up in a public place and the reason for such a fight was concealed by both parties, such an altercation also could not fall within the definition of terrorism.,“Therefore, the courts should not hurriedly jump to the conclusion that such offences are acts of terrorism and shall not forcibly bring them within the ambit of the provisions of ATA,” the judgement said.,If the legislature intended to bring such crimes within the ambit of ATA, it would have not employed the word “terrorism” or “terrorist activities”.,The comprehensive list of terrorism-related offences against the public, places of worship and educational institutions, offences against law enforcement agencies, and the armed forces clearly represented the intent of those who made the law, the verdict noted.,“Even though ordinary crime can have a devastating, gruesome and heart-rending effect on human beings, this by itself should not be reason enough to bring the crime within the fold of terrorism or to attract the provisions of sections 6 and 7 of the ATA,” the verdict said."

They were ‘misusing’ the name of ‘jihadi organisations’ for furthering their ‘un-Islamic motives’, it added.,Police uncertain about rift among militants as Ansarul Sharia Pakistan claims responsibility,It should be mentioned that ASP is the same militant group which itself has claimed responsibility for the killing of security personnel. Previously, the pamphlets found after the incidents stated that the killing of law enforcers in the city was ‘revenge’ for the killing of militants in ‘encounters’ and alleged injustices meted out to the families of militants. ,The ASP had claimed responsibility for the killing of the men in the latest incident, said Malir SSP Rao Anwar Ahmed.,“The three bodies were found near the closed Northern Bypass police checkpoint,” said SSP Rao Anwar.

Police surgeon Dr Aijaz Khokhar told Dawn that they sustained multiple bullet wounds on their head and chest.,Asked if the pamphlet indicated a ‘rift’ among the militants belonging to ASP, SHO Anar Khan said that investigation was under way. ,Responding to the query whether the deceased were ‘militants’ who had been murdered by other ‘militants’, the officer said that at this stage, the police could not say anything, as efforts were being made to ascertain the identity of these three men.,In recent weeks, the same militant outfit, by throwing similar pamphlets at crime scenes, had claimed responsibility for the killing of four policemen in SITE, a deputy superintendent of traffic police and his driver in Azizabad, and the PQR officer on the Northern Bypass."

,PESHAWAR: A rare cruciform relic casket of Gandhara civilisation was reported missing from the reserve collection of Sir Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum Museum at University of Peshawar about six months ago.,However, the administration of the university is dilly-dallying to hold a probe into the matter and take necessary legal action.,The relic casket was rare and excavated by famous archaeologist late Prof AH Dani from the archaeological site of Sheikhan Dheri in Charsadda in 1962. It was highlighted in exhibition catalogue in 2008. It was even taken for display in Bonn, Paris and Zurich in 2010.,In early December last year, an assistant curator initially reported a cruciform relic casket and an oil lamp, both pieces of Gandhara art, missing from the reserve collection at the museum.,No action taken against people responsible for taking care of artifacts at UoP museum,In January, once again after search when it was ascertained that the relic was missing, Dr Zakirullah Jan, the curator of the museum, informed Dr Mukhtar Durrani, the chairman of archaeology department, about it.,The chairman formed a committee comprising archaeologists, who after various visits conducted a thorough probe. The committee also came to know about a fire incident and whitewash activities that took place last year, rising suspicions that the object was misplaced during these activities. ,“I had formed a probe committee comprising experts. They proved that the relic was missing. I still don’t know why an FIR was not registered against those, who showed negligence, instead another probe committee was set up recently,” said Dr Mukhatr Durrani.,He also sounded angry at UoP administration for not keeping him in loop while another probe committee was constituted and the first probe findings were brushed aside.,“I fear the second probe committee is to protect somebody. Whom? I don’t know,” alleged the chairman of archaeology department. ,He said that he had reason to believe so because he was asked to stay away from the matter and told that the museum was not under the archaeology department at UoP. ,Dr Mukhatr Durrani said that action should have been taken in the light of the previous probe committee. Everything was done in a haphazard manner, he added. ,He insisted that an FIR should have been lodged and the museum should have been sealed once it was established that a relic was missing after the committee’s report. ,He said that the committee did not name anyone but those taking care of the objects should be held responsible for the negligence.,The UoP administration was contacted to get its views on the issue of the missing relic but to no avail.,“Now they are saying that oil lamp, a small one, was found lying somewhere but the relic casket is still missing,” said Dr Mukhtar Durrani. He added that he would not be surprised if the casket was replaced with a ‘fake one’ to save someone’s skin. However, he said that he would not let such a forgery take place.,Dr Zakiruall Jan, the curator of the museum, when contacted, simply said that re-verification of the objects was going on at the moment and they were unable to locate the relic casket.,“I was the one, who reported it missing. There are other staff members too who were responsible to take care of the collection,” said Dr Zakirullah Jan, who has been working as curator for about a year. ,He said that he wanted to verify the artifacts after a fire incident and white wash took place last year and so far there was problem in re-verifying the relic casket. ,He said that the basement was full of artifacts. Some were dumped there so they were verifying objects in the basement reserve collection, he added.,“I was the one who reported it missing and called for an inquiry. I won’t call it missing or stolen. We are just having trouble finding it at the moment,” said Dr Zakirullah Jan. He added that an inquiry committee was set up to probe everyone responsible to take care of the artifacts but he knew neither about the findings of the previous committee nor members of the new one."

We are now asking them mandatorily check the bride’s age proof. We are also asking mosques to include messages against such marriages in their sermons.” Rahim said the five to 10-minute announcements at mosques will spread awareness against child marriages.,The police have been cracking down on child marriages in Hyderabad and surrounding areas but officials said most of marriages with Arab men are performed secretly and it is easier to gain access to people through sermons at mosques."

190,2017-08-31,Verdict in Benazir killing case today,"ISLAMABAD: An Anti-Terrorism court (ATC) will announce its judgement in the Benazir Bhutto killing case on Thursday (today) at Adiala jail. ,ATC Judge Asghar Ali Khan reserved the verdict on Wednesday after conducting day-to-day proceedings in the case that had been pending adjudication for about a decade. ,Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Chief Prosecutor Mohammad Azhar Chaudhry in his concluding arguments disowned the prosecution evidence of audio record and transcript of telephonic conversation of the former chief of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) with a cleric in which he had congratulated the terrorists on carrying out the successful attack on the former prime minister. ,Mr Chaudhry termed it a “fake story” fabricated by then military dictator retired Gen Pervez Musharraf to mislead the investigators. He claimed that Gen Musharraf, through his aide former director general of the National Crisis Management Cell retired Brigadier Javed Iqbal Cheema, had disseminated this fake evidence to save his skin. ,According to him, Gen Musharraf was an accused and he hatched a conspiracy to kill Benazir Bhutto because he perceived her a potential threat to his rule. ,Mr Chaudhry also accused then deputy inspector general Saud Aziz of abetting the crime. He alleged that Aziz had transferred then superintendent of police Ashfaq Anwar from Liaquat Bagh to Sadiqabad, leaving the former Pakistan Peoples Party chairperson at the mercy of terrorists. ,The prosecutor further accused the senior police officer of not conducting autopsy of slain Benazir to detract the investigation. ,Rebutting the allegations, Ghanim Aabir, the counsel for Saud Aziz, said that after the firing incident on a convoy of Nawaz Sharif on Islamabad Expressway, his client had sent Ashfaq Anwar there. ,About the post-mortem, the counsel said Wajid Zia, who was also a senior member of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) constituted to probe the Benazir murder case, had testified before the ATC that Rawalpindi police had made all arrangements to conduct autopsy of Benazir, but it was linked to the consent of her husband Asif Ali Zardari. ,Mr Aabir argued said that since the autopsy of a body was done to determine the cause of death, the doctors of Rawalpindi General Hospital had mentioned the cause of her death in their reports and, therefore, there was no need of post-mortem on Ms Bhutto’s body. According to him, last rites of slain Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi were performed without a post-mortem because the cause of her death was obvious. ,Even otherwise, the counsel claimed, the post-mortem procedure was the job of the investigating officer and since Saud Aziz was not the investigating officer, he could not be held responsible for that. ,The counsel for five TTP suspects — Rafaqat Hussain, Husnain Gul, Sher Zaman, Aitzaz Shah and Abdul Rashid — also concluded his arguments. They denied the charges levelled against them by the prosecution. ,The trial of the five suspects started in January 2008. Since then, eight different judges heard the case. The PPP government had in 2009 ordered a fresh investigation into the Benazir murder case and the FIA’s JIT implicated Gen Musharraf, Saud Aziz and SSP Khurram Shehzad as accused. The prosecution has submitted eight challans to the ATC that separated the trial of Gen Musharraf after he left the country. ,The ATC will announce the verdict with regard to the five TTP suspects and two police officers. The court will resume trial against Gen Musharraf after his return to Pakistan. "
191,2017-08-31,More ominous disappearances,"			
,PAKISTAN observed the International Day of Victims of Enforced Disappearances yesterday (Aug 30) at a time when this form of attack on life and liberty has acquired a new and more sinister dimension.,Sindh is in the grip of a wave of abductions.According to Sindh Human Rights Defenders, a body that has been monitoring cases of missing persons, out of the 120 or so victims identified since Jan 1 this year, 84 disappeared this month (until Aug 22).,Enormously more worrying is the fact that eight of the persons wrongly described as missing were known to be striving for the recovery of victims of involuntary disappearance. They are: general secretary Voice of Missing Persons, Sindh, Punhal Sario from Hyderabad; Abbas Lund from Dadu; journalist Ghulam Rasool Burfat; writer Inamullah Abbasi; Raza Jarwar; Partab Shivani from Mithi; Naseer Kumbhar also from Mithi; and Shoaib Korejo from Hyderabad. The last mentioned three have returned home but the fate of the other five was unknown till the time of writing.,As is usual in such cases those who have returned home are not talking. They communicate through their relatives in the fewest possible words. It is possible they wish to keep quiet out of fear of reprisal. Anyway, the authorities and civil society organisations both have a duty to carry out a Supreme Court directive about recording the statements of all those victims who survive the ordeal of enforced disappearances. ,The identity of the state functionaries responsible for disappearances is no secret. What the authorities must do now is to ascertain whether the victims were picked up for their views or political affiliation. The impression that the space for freedom of opinion and association is shrinking must be removed. ,Pakistan continues to attract harsh notices from international organisations.,Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to attract harsh notices from international organisations. It has not sincerely and adequately addressed the issues raised over several years by the UN Working Group on Enforced Disappearances. Last month, the UN Human Rights Committee, in its concluding remarks after hearings on Pakistan’s initial report under the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, made a pointed reference to disappearances and called upon Pakistan to criminalise the act of causing a person’s disappearance, ensure protection to the victims’ families and create a mechanism for offering them due compensation.,Once again Pakistan has been advised to strengthen the authority and capacity, financial and personnel-wise of the Commission of Inquiry into Enforced Disappearances. The justification for this recommendation will become clear if we take a fresh look at what this commission has been doing.,It had inherited only 138 cases of disappearance from the commission of three retired judges who had dealt with the issue in 2010. This new commission though headed by Javed Iqbal, a former judge of the Supreme Court, is not as powerful as its mandate demands. Neither a statutory nor a judicial commission, it is only a commission of inquiry created under a notification of the interior ministry. The law-enforcement authorities treat it with scant respect.,Since March 1, 2011, when it started functioning, the commission received till the end of June this year 4,059 cases, out of which it has disposed of 2,801, leaving 1,258 cases pending. Incidentally the commission had slightly fewer cases — 1,219 — on Dec 31, 2016. That alone tells us a story that is none too complimentary.,The figures of cases decided conceal, as has been noted before, a strange pattern of disposal. For instance, during June this year 45 cases were decided. This does not mean that 45 victims of enforced disappearance rejoined their families; it only means the present status of the 45 individuals concerned was confirmed. While 22 persons were reported to have returned home, 23 were not. Out of these 23, two were found to have died away from home, five were under detention at internment centres, seven were facing trial on criminal charges, and nine cases had been dropped for various reasons.,The highest number of cases received from a province since 2011 came from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (1,555) followed by Sindh (1,047), Punjab (858), and Balochistan (284). The case disposal pattern is quite interesting. Sindh has the best disposal rate — 756 cases out of 1,047, or 72.2 per cent; were disposed. Sindh was followed by Punjab — 440 cases out of 858 or 51.30pc; KP — 657 cases out of 1,555 or 41.2pc. Balochistan has the lowest disposal rate at 104 cases out of 284 or 36.6pc.,There is a need to look deeper into these figures. In nearly all cases of persons who returned home the information was provided by the police. Why can’t the commission ask police officials to produce the victims traced by them? The commission could then record the dates of a victim’s disappearance and his recovery and other much-needed information. ,The urgency of a review of the whole set-up has become manifest. What is needed is a high-powered, properly staffed and financially well-supported commission not merely to trace the victims of enforced disappearance but also to identify their tormentors for prosecution, and to determine compensation due to the families. ,Before that, however, the government must ratify the international convention on disappearances and make disappearance a penal offence. Further, the report of the judges’ commission of 2010 must be made public. If it contains classified matter that the government does not wish to share with the public that may be presented in parliament at a closed session. If the judges’ commission had suggested a practical way of freeing the state of the stigma of tolerating disappearances, that should not be left to be consumed by moths in record rooms.,PS. The family of a missing Lahore woman, social activist-journalist Zeenat Shahzadi, was again told last Thursday to keep waiting, to keep hoping against hope."

The ATC had named Musharraf in the case in February 2011. ,Saud Aziz, who was police chief of Rawalpindi when Bhutto was assassinated in 2007, and Khurram Shahzad, a former Superintendent of Police (SP) at Rawal Town, were each awarded 17 years in prison. The two, who were out on bail, have already been arrested.,The two former policemen have each been awarded 10 years in prison under Section 119 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and seven years each under Section 201 of the PPC.,They have also been fined Rs500,000 each; in case they do not pay the fine, they will have to spend another six months in jail, said the court.  ,Aziz and Shahzad, who had been released on bail in 2011, were accused of negligence in security arrangements which subsequently led to the assassination of the former prime minister in a gun-and-bomb attack outside Rawalpindi’s Liaquat Bagh on Dec 27, 2007. ,The five TTP suspects — Rafaqat Hussain, Husnain Gul, Sher Zaman, Aitzaz Shah and Abdul Rashid — have been cleared of all charges in the murder trial. ,Court has directed authorities to seize Musharraf's properties and issue perpetual arrest warrants for the former dictator. ,A joint investigation team ,, saying that his government did not provide adequate security to the former prime minister despite her repeated requests.,Apart from Musharraf, five other men —  Baitullah Mehsud, Ahmad Gul, Iqramullah, Abdullah, and Faizullah — have been declared absconders. ,During the case, 68 witnesses appeared on behalf of the prosecution and recorded their testimonies.

Police said they had initiated a search for the suspect.,At the time, police officials had said that the officer had opened fire at Taimur after his refusal to stop the vehicle. ,The incident had sparked rioting and protests on Islamabad's IJP Road at the time, with the victim's family dismissing the police statement and saying there had been no prior warning or order to stop before the officer opened fire.,In January 2016, a youth in Karachi was shot dead by police officials for allegedly not stopping at a check post in the Gizri area.,The two police officials on duty – Altaf and Mudassir – were been taken into custody."

195,2017-09-01,Benazir's murder could have been prevented with appropriate security measures: ATC,"A Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court (ATC) which announced the verdict in the Benazir Bhutto murder case on Thursday stated that the assassination of the former premier ""could have been prevented if the Rawalpindi District Police had taken adequate security measures."" ,The ATC in its 46-page long order suggested Bhutto's murder was the result of an inadequate response to security threats.,It concluded that ""Bhutto was killed in an attack as a result of firing, followed by a bomb blast caused by an unknown suicide bomber on her way back from addressing a political gathering at Liaquat Bagh."",According to the court order, explosives were detonated near Bhutto's car, as she left the rally, by a 15-year-old boy. ""No one believes that this boy acted alone,"" the order added. ,""A range of government officials failed profoundly in their efforts first to protect Ms Bhutto and second to investigate with vigour all those responsible for her murder, not only in the execution of the attack, but also in its conception, planning and financing,"" it said.,However, the exact cause of her death remains unknown as a post-mortem examination was not conducted during the course of the investigation, the court noted. ,It also noted that the investigation following the murder was marred by inconsistencies, and that the prosecution had been unable to establish a link between the murder conspiracy and the five Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan suspects accused.,The court concluded that the Elite police unite that was supposed to provide 'box' security for Bhutto's vehicle was ""not available and was removed by the accused Saud Aziz, the then city police officer (CPO) [Rawalpindi]... There was no emergency plan in case of any undue incident."",""The prosecution is found to have miserably failed to prove its case against accused Rafaqat Hussain, Husnain Gul, Rasheed Ahmed and Sher Zaman beyond any shadow of doubt, hence, they are acquitted by giving benefit of doubt,"" the order said.,CPO Saud Aziz and Khurram Shahzad, a former Superintendent of Police (SP) at Rawal Town, were each awarded 17 years in prison by the court. ,The court added that a separate case would be pursued against former president Gen (retd) Pervez Musharraf.,The court order observed that although Bhutto was known to face threats from a number of sources, the investigation into these threats focused on small fry rather than those heading the threat groups. ,It also said that investigators dismissed the possibility of involvement by members of the 'establishment' that Bhutto had identified as threats.,""Ms Bhutto faced serious threats in Pakistan from a number of sources... Notwithstanding these threats, the investigation into her assassination focused on pursuing lower level operatives allegedly linked to Baitullah Mehsud.,The Commission finds it disturbing that little was done to investigate Baitullah Mehsud himself, Al Qaeda and any individuals or organisations that might have worked on, supported or otherwise been involved directly or indirectly in the planning or execution of the assassination. ,Investigators also dismissed the possibility of involvement by elements of the Establishment, including the three persons identified by Ms Bhutto as threats to her in her October 16, 2007, letter to General Musharraf."",""The federal government under General Musharraf, although fully aware of, and tracking, the serious threats to Ms Bhutto’s security, did little more than pass on those threats to her and provincial authorities and were not proactive in neutralising them or ensuring that the security provided was commensurate to the threats. ,The federal government failed in its primary responsibility to provide effective protection to Ms Bhutto on her return to Pakistan.,The federal government lacked a comprehensive security plan for Ms Bhutto, relying instead on provincial authorities, but then failed to issue to them the necessary instructions. ,Particularly inexcusable was the government’s failure to direct provincial authorities to provide Ms Bhutto the same stringent and specific security measures it ordered on October 22, 2007, for two other former prime ministers who belonged to the main political party supporting General Musharraf. ,This discriminatory treatment is profoundly troubling given the devastating attempt on her life only three days earlier and the specific threats against her which were being tracked by the Inter-Services Intelligence.,Responsibility for Ms Bhutto’s security on the day of her assassination rested with the federal government, the government of Punjab and the Rawalpindi District Police. None of these entities took necessary measures to respond to the extraordinary, fresh and urgent security risks that they knew she faced."",A press conference in which Bhutto's cause of death was announced prior to any formal investigation ""hindered"" the investigation, the court observed.,""The government press conference conducted by Brigadier Cheema on December 28, 2007, the day after the assassination, was ordered by General Musharraf. ,The government’s assertion that Ms Bhutto’s death was caused when she hit her head on the lever of her vehicle’s escape hatch, and that Baitullah Mehsud and Al Qaeda were responsible for the suicide bomber were made well before any proper investigation had been initiated. ,This action preempted, prejudiced and hindered the subsequent investigation. ,An unequivocal determination as to the cause and means of Ms Bhutto’s death would have required an autopsy."" ,However, no autopsy of Bhutto was ever conducted. ,""Decision to use fire hose on the crime scene within 1 hour and 40 minutes of the occurrence was unjustified and had resulted in destroying the crime scene, this destruction made it extremely difficult to collect more evidence for DNA tests. ,The act of both the police officers constituted as criminal negligence which had caused irreparable damage to the crime scene. ,The non-conducting of a post-mortem examination on the body of Benazir Bhutto also damaged the investigation due to which clear cause of death of  Benazir Bhutto was not established. ,The Commission is persuaded that the Rawalpindi police chief, CPO Saud Aziz, did not act independently of higher authorities, either in the decision to hose down the crime scene or to impede the post-mortem examination.,The deliberate prevention by CPO Saud Aziz of a post-mortem examination of Ms Bhutto hindered a definitive determination of the cause of her death. ,It was patently unrealistic for the CPO to expect that Mr Zardari would allow an autopsy on his arrival in Pakistan at Chaklala Airbase nearly seven hours after his wife’s death and after her remains had been placed in a coffin and brought to the airport. ,The autopsy should have been carried out at Rawalpindi General Hospital long before Mr Zardari arrived.,The Commission has uncovered no new evidence to suggest a gunshot injury to Ms Bhutto. ,Instead, a senior PPP official who publicly purported soon after the assassination to have seen indications of a bullet injury admitted to the Commission that she did not have direct knowledge of such an injury."",""The investigation was severely hampered by intelligence agencies and other government officials, which impeded an unfettered search for the truth. ,Despite their explanation to the Commission that they do not have a mandate to conduct criminal investigations, intelligence agencies including the Inter- Services Intelligence agency (ISI) were present during key points in the police investigation, including the gathering of evidence at the crime scene and the forensic examination of Ms Bhutto’s vehicle, playing a role that the police were reluctant to reveal to the Commission.,More significantly, the ISI conducted parallel investigations, gathering evidence and detaining suspects.,Evidence gathered from such parallel investigations was selectively shared with the police. ,What little direction police investigators had was provided to them by the intelligence agencies. ,However, the bulk of the information was not shared with police investigators. ,In fact, investigators on both the Karachi (Karsaz bombing) and Rawalpindi (Bhutto's assassination) cases were unaware of information the ISI possessed about terrorist cells targeting Ms Bhutto and were unaware that the ISI had detained four persons in late October 2007 for the Karachi attack.,More broadly, no aspect of the Commission’s inquiry was untouched by credible assertions of politicised and clandestine action by the intelligence services – the ISI, Military Intelligence, and the Intelligence Bureau. ,On virtually every issue the Commission addressed, intelligence agencies played a pervasive role, including a central involvement in the political negotiations regarding Ms Bhutto’s return to Pakistan and the conduct of the elections.,The Commission believes that the failures of the police and other officials to react effectively to Ms Bhutto’s assassination were, in most cases, deliberate. ,In other cases, the failures were driven by uncertainty in the minds of many officials as to the extent of the involvement of intelligence agencies. ,These officials, in part fearing involvement by the intelligence agencies, were unsure of how vigorously they ought to pursue actions that they knew, as professionals, they should have taken."""

200,2017-09-05,Minors living with convicted mothers vulnerable,"			
,MANSEHRA: After giving her a bath, prisoner Kaneez Sughra wrapped her three-year-old daughter in a piece of cloth covering most of her body.,Though 39 women detained in her barrack of Mansehra district jail saw the woman do all that, no one knew how adversely the environment would impact on the mind of the child, whose mother served a jail term.,The minor is not alone. Four more such children are also living there with mothers convicted on various criminal charges.,“We don’t give anything extra to women living with children in jail but a specified quantity of milk under the jail manual,” superintendent of the district jail Tahir Shahbaz said.,Jails and courts have no special places for such children and thus, exposing them to hostile environment,He said there was not an isolated barrack for women prisoners living with their minor child here and anywhere else in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.,Experts say the minors growing up behind bars even for no fault of theirs are exposed to viral infections and psychological problems.,Such children also accompany mothers to courts for trial in their respective cases and thus, becoming vulnerable to another hostile environment. Ironically, the courts in Abbottabad, Haripur, Battagram, Kohistan and Mansehra don’t have special spaces for such children and mothers.,Miserable are the conditions in Haripur’s central jail, where women prisoners with minor children are kept with convicts without children.,Neither the federal nor provincial governments have taken serious efforts to provide these children with an environment, which keep their little minds from adverse impact of the time spent behind bars.,Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s judiciary led by Peshawar High Court Chief Justice Yahya Afridi has taken initiatives for creating trauma-free environment in courts for children accompanying parents for trials.The situation in Hazara jail is ironic as the children accompanying mothers are kept in barracks having other women prisoners. Also, there is no isolated space for them on the court’s premises. ,The situation in lower courts is no different as the children going there with parents in family cases or otherwise come across hostile environment. There are no separate spaces for them and thus, rendering them vulnerable.,Also, such children lack counseling services and so, the chance of their getting involved in crimes after leaving jails is high.,Recently, the Peshawar High Court wrote separate letters to district and session judges and qazis across the province about the establishment of thematic parks in district courts for children affected by parental dispute.,It also called for the creation of special spaces for children and women coming to courts.,“The children, particularly adolescents, are the victims of dispute between husband and wife. They suffer psychological and physical trauma when relations between their parents come to sore and situation further worsens when matter is brought to courts where these children witness criminals handcuffed and their parents indecent altercation in court and undergo abusive and suffer from social neglects,” read the letter.,The court also ordered the relocation of family courts to places away from full public view.,“Outdoor entertaining park should be developed with necessary facilities, toys etc so children can play there when their parents appear in courts adding if space for park is not available such a room should be developed for the purpose,” it asked the subordinate courts.,The letter also called for the construction of washrooms and lavatories for such children on the court’s premises.,After receiving that letter, district and sessions judge of Mansehra Muzzamil Shah Khattak sought a report from the family court judges, Imran Shaheen and Alia Bibi, regarding the establishment of a thematic park for children accompanying parents to their courts.,In a separate letter, the high court also asked the district and sessions judges to encourage a voluntarily counseling of such vulnerable children through girl colleges’ students and dispose of family court cases expeditiously saying this will keep children from hostile environment for a long period.

201,2017-09-06,Raped woman had to ‘bribe’ police for filing case,"RAHIM YAR KHAN: A married woman who was allegedly raped and blackmailed because of a video clip of the rape made by her tormentors, had to bribe lower police staff to get a case registered against the suspects after a senior officer declined to help her in getting justice. ,Narrating her ordeal at the local press club where she had come with her husband on Tuesday, ‘N’, a resident of Mauza Bhuta Kot of Sheikh Wahan area, said she worked as a match-maker and was lured to Rahim Yar Khan by a relative on the pretext of visiting a family in Multan for the purpose in May this year. ,Instead of taking her to Multan, she said the prime suspect ‘H’ and his friend ‘J’ took her to a house here in Gulshan-i-Iqbal, that was owned by one of their acquaintances.She said at the house, both ‘H’ and ‘J’ raped her in the presence of their friend and the suspects made a video clip of the crime. ,The suspects threatened her that they would post the clip on social media if she informed anybody about the rape, she said. She said later the suspects started blackmailing her and threatened her they would sell the video clip if she did not pay them money. ,She claimed that she had been giving the suspects money on different occasions by selling her cattle and even jewellery and so far they had extracted around Rs300,000 from her. Meanwhile, she said the suspects sold the video clip to many persons against Rs1,000 each despite taking money from her. ,Being unable to arrange more money, she said she approached the Saddar deputy superintendent of police (DSP) with a complaint but he did not listen to her. ,Later, she lodged an FIR (No 250/17) on Aug 31, 2017, against the suspects under Section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code after paying Rs15,000 bribe to a sub-inspector Ehsan and the moharrar of Saddar police station. ,After that the police arrested ‘H’ while ‘J’ and the house owner got interim bails. She said now the suspects were forcing her for a “reconciliation” and threatening her with dire consequences if she pursued the case.,She said she did not get a case registered under cyber crime law because she was illiterate and did not know about it. ,The district police public relations officer denied all the allegations levelled by ‘N’ against police officials, saying the police would act according to the law in the light of the medical report of ‘N’ that was still awaited."
202,2017-09-06,Who killed Benazir Bhutto?,"			
,IT is indeed a ,. Almost 10 years after her assassination, Benazir Bhutto’s murderers have not been identified let alone convicted. While the anti-terrorist court has acquitted the five main accused for lack of evidence, two police officers charged with negligence have been convicted. ,So the mystery surrounding the murder of the twice-elected prime minister and one of Pakistan’s most charismatic and popular leaders remains unresolved. Or is this really so? Last week’s ruling of the single-judge court has raised many questions about the dubious way in which the investigation and the trial in the high-profile murder case were conducted.  ,Indeed, the non-serious approach was evident by the fact that the charge sheet was altered many times and a number of judges were changed over the past eight years. More importantly, how did the prosecution fail to establish charges against the five detained suspects despite claims by the investigators of having collected “irrefutable evidence” against them? They had also reportedly confessed to their involvement in the murder plot. ,The ruling is inexplicable but not surprising given the callous way in which the case was handled by successive governments. Besides forming several joint investigation committees, the help of Scotland Yard and even the United Nations was acquired. But all that seems to have failed to bring the culprits to justice. Surely, political gamesmanship made the investigations more intricate. ,The mystery surrounding the murder of one of Pakistan’s most popular leaders remains unresolved.,It was apparent that the case became a tool for settling political scores with the result that investigations conducted by various agencies were thrown into the bin. In his ruling, the judge declared that the prosecution appeared confused. In fact, the case was doomed from the very outset with the frequent change of judges and prosecutors. One of the prosecutors was also killed in mysterious circumstances.  ,Also the judgement gives credence to the suspicion that there is neither will nor capacity to prosecute the terrorists who have gotten away with murder. There has also been debate on whether the judge was fearful of convicting the suspects allegedly associated with the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Al Qaeda. The TTP had demanded their release in the past. ,Interestingly, the state prosecutors themselves refuted the investigation reports that had implicated the militant group and its top leaders including Baitullah Mehsud who was later killed in an American drone strike. The formation of various joint investigation committees and the involvement of the UN in the probe added to the problem. It was a purely political move by the PPP government to involve the international organisation in an investigation that was strictly a domestic affair, ignoring the advice of the foreign ministry. Moreover the mandate of the commission was also kept limited. ,The UN commission report that had raised some questions about the role of the military intelligence agencies in prematurely washing down the site of the assassination thus destroying some key evidence was later criticised by the Pakistani authorities. The Musharraf government was also accused by the UN investigators of not providing the former prime minister enough security despite a threat to her life. In fact, the government demanded that the UN remove part of the report. This muddle completely destroyed the case. ,Almost all the investigation reports had established what they described as irrefutable evidence that linked the suicide bombers and other suspects to the madressah Haqqania, Akora Khattak. The assassination plot was reportedly hatched at this institution where the suicide bombers had resided.    ,One of the largest and most influential seminaries in the country, Haqqania has long been seen as a hub of both the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban. Despite its known association with militancy, the seminary led by Maulana Samiul Haq has benefited from the patronage of successive governments. The PTI government in Khyber Pakhunkhawa provided the seminary, also known as ‘university of jihad’, a generous grant of Rs300 million. ,It was indeed a well-organised plot. The five boys/men who were arrested weeks after the incident, some of them in their teens, had allegedly received ideological as well as military training at the militant camps in Waziristan. They may not have been the masterminds but they appeared to be critical cogs in the murder plan. ,Forensic reports and phone calls had reportedly established their involvement in the murder. But the prosecutors kept changing their line of argument during more than 300 hearings. Perhaps the most damaging stance taken by the prosecutors was that Baitullah Mehsud was implicated by the Musharraf government to divert the investigations away from the possible involvement of the intelligence agencies in the murder. ,Surely, the prosecution had not been solely responsible for the shift. In fact, this position reflected the thinking of the PPP leadership that was in power over five years during the critical period of the trial. The same line of argument was pursued till the end thus weakening the case against the five militant suspects. ,Musharraf’s name was added in the list of the accused, but no substantive evidence could be produced to implicate the former military ruler. While the court has ordered the confiscation of Musharraf’s properties for absconding, his case has been separated.,Indeed, the most shocking part of the ruling was the conviction and sentencing of two senior police officers on duty in Rawalpindi city on the day of the  assassination. Both officers who were only accused of negligence have each been awarded 17-year jail sentences. Such harsh action for a questionable decision (they may have acted on the instructions of higher authorities) is quite mind-boggling. That leaves the main question unanswered: who killed Benazir Bhutto? ,While the PPP leadership has rightly been criticised for not pursuing the case more seriously during its rule, the trial has also exposed the shortcomings of our investigation agencies, the prosecution process and the judiciary. It is not just about the PPP but the entire country losing to the terrorists one of its finest and bravest leaders. It is yet another case of high-profile political murder that may never be solved. Who is to be blamed for this tragedy? "

She remembers the exact day, March 3, 2015, when he was taken away. “They used to be happy children sharing their school stories with me. Now they look for reasons to stay away from school,” the mother added.  ,Shaista, another mother, said her husband, Shahzad Khan, was taken away on Oct 28, 2015. “I have three school-going daughters, too, and with their father gone making two ends meet is a big challenge,” she said.,Ms Riasatullah said that her husband was picked up on Nov 18, 2015. “I was expecting my second child then. My baby son has not seen his father,” she said as her older, seven-year-old son stood beside her, holding his father’s framed photograph. ,Meanwhile, Sagheerunisa Begum, her eyes brimming, listened to their stories. “My son Furqan was not married but I miss him dearly,” she said, adding that he had been gone since May 6, 2015. “We have done everything within our means to have him recovered, including filing a petition in court but to no avail.” ,‘There can be countless other issues behind the disappearances of people’,The meeting was called on Tuesday by the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) to share the situation of Sindh regarding enforced disappearances and missing persons with the media. “Enforced disappearances are a violation of human rights,” said NCHR chairman retired Justice Ali Nawaz Chowhan. “And we being a watchdog organisation can question the law enforcement agencies said to be involved in the disappearances,” he added. ,“So when we sent a notice to the ministry of interior about it all, we were informed that they didn’t have these missing people though they did mention that Frontier Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa may know something about their whereabouts and asked us to give them some time to find out and revert,” Justice Chowhan said. ,“It was a positive thing as there was not a complete denial after all. And everyone’s hopes were up suddenly. But now we have received this second letter from them saying that they also don’t have any information about these missing persons,” he said. “At this we have told them that their answer is vague and, therefore, unacceptable to us.”,Anis Haroon, a member of the Sindh NCHR, meanwhile, also added that they were having a difficult time in believing the government when they say one thing one day and something else another day. ,Justice Chowhan said that there should be an internal redressal system to take up this issue. “We ask the prime minister and interior minister for an internal redressal system and a joint investigative team for this,” he said. ,“There can be countless other issues behind the disappearances of people such as personal vendetta or maybe the work of a foreign enemy. The government should not get maligned unnecessarily especially when it might not have anything to do with this. There is so much propaganda about Pakistan and our law enforcement agencies,” he said.,Another issue which Justice Chowhan wanted to talk about when speaking of propaganda against Pakistan was the issue of forced conversions. “We see too much of this happening in Tharparkar and among the Kalash. There girls are being exploited. Things are bad and it is very sad to see Jinnah’s pledge to the minorities here being betrayed,” he said. ,“In Tharparkar, there are so many madressahs, which openly spread hate speech. The ministry of religious affairs needs to filter these,” he said. ,The third issue that he was also concerned about was the feared environmental disaster in the shape of the Gorano reservoir in Tharparkar. “I hear that the most fertile land in Islamkot will come under this [reservoir],” he said."

254,2017-09-20,90 ‘high-profile militants’ shifted to other jails from Central Prison Karachi,"KARACHI: The Sindh government has shifted some 90 “high-profile” inmates from the Central Prison Karachi to jails in other districts of the province and Rawalpindi on advice of intelligence and law enforcement agencies, an official confirmed to Dawn on Tuesday.,The key report about illegal activities of the inmates inside the prison came from the Counter-Terrorism Department, which recommended their shifting from the central prison to other such facilities in Sindh and Punjab to “break an organised network”. The move came after a series of meetings on the issue of jails’ security, the official added.,“The process began in July 2017,” he said. “The high-profile militants belonging to banned outfits, both under trial as well as those serving their terms, were shifted from Karachi Central Prison to jails in other parts of the province. So far 90 have been moved and under the plan some 270 would face the same fate. More inmates would be transferred to other jails in phases.”,The move is meant to break an ‘organised network’ and improve prison security,Of the 90 prisoners, he said, two had been moved to a prison in Rawalpindi, eight to Larkana and 80 to Sukkur jail.,The proposal to shift the inmates, he said, was forwarded by the intelligence and security authorities for different reasons and in the initial phases, militants of banned outfits were shifted away from the central prison.,“The jail in Karachi is overcrowded and obviously that causes many other problems. The shifting [of militants] is part of the several measures we have taken for security and good administration,” said the official.,In June 2017 two “high-profile militants” of the banned Lashkar-i-Jhangvi (LJ) allegedly involved in over 60 murders had escaped from the Central Prison Karachi. Within a couple of weeks after their escape, the Pakistan Rangers, Sindh, conducted a search operation inside the prison where they were assisted by the Pakistan army, intelligence agencies and police.,In the sweeping operation, the paramilitary force claimed to have seized hundreds of mobile phones, dozens of TV sets and over Rs3.5 million. The security agencies during the exercise also found an active mobile phone network in the prison which was being run with the help of modern devices to avoid mobile phone jammers.,The Rangers led the operation — the first of its kind in the past 25 years — that resulted in the recovery of the items not allowed under the jail manual and included physical search of around 6,000 prisoners belonging to all political, religious and banned outfits in different barracks.,After three months of the prisoners’ escape the Sindh police booked officials of the central prison on charges of abetting the escape of the two high-profile militants. The officials have been booked under the antiterrorism law for failing to implement the prison’s rules. They face several charges, ranging from aiding the undertrial escapees to giving false information.,Apart from “breaking criminals’ network”, the official said the move to shift the high-profile militants was also part of an exercise to improve jails’ security. It also included the deployment of more security men in and around the prison and the Rangers-led search operation.,“The key issue in managing jails is overcrowding. As it leads to several other issues, it must be addressed at the earliest. You can’t get better results in the long term with temporary and short-term moves,” he added.,The two jails in Karachi are reported to be the most overcrowded of the 25 prisons of Sindh. They house inmates nearly three times their capacity. A recent report prepared by the prisons department said that the Karachi Central Prison, the second-oldest jail after Hyderabad’s, housed 6,174 prisoners while its authorised capacity was around 2,400 inmates.

257,2017-09-21,Police reluctant to register vehicle theft cases,"RAWALPINDI: Non-registration of first information reports (FIRs) by police has been a chronic problem. Contrary to the claims made by the Punjab government and the provincial police chief, 725 citizens could not get FIRs registered against the theft of their vehicles so far this year, according to a police document available with Dawn.,Of the 1,210 vehicles stolen or snatched at gunpoint since January 2017, owners of only 485 could get the FIRs registered. The police had earlier introduced front desks to facilitate the complainants and are now planning to set up Khidmat Markaz in different districts. ,When contacted, Nayab Haider, a spokesperson for the inspector general of the Punjab police, said the objective of the front desks and Khidmat Markaz was to resolve public complaints and help the citizens in getting driving licences and character certificates. He said all documentation would be completed in one centre and sent digitally to the Khidmat Markaz concerned for delivery through couriers. ,“The establishment of the Khidmat Markaz could be another game changer in service delivery by the Punjab police,” he claimed. ,But many citizens wondered why the police were reluctant to register vehicle theft FIRs even after establishing the front desks. ,According to police sources, the 1,210 vehicles stolen in the district from January to August included 513 cars and 697 motorcycles. ,Of the total vehicles stolen, cases of only 485 were registered by the police while owners of 305 cars and 421 motorcycles could not get the FIRs registered. ,The police registered FIRs of only 208 stolen cars and 276 motorcycles. In January, 73 cars and 75 motorcycles were stolen while in February the number was 63 cars and 71 motorcycles, in March 37 cars and 73 motorcycles and in April 50 cars and 63 motorcycles. ,Thieves took away 78 cars and 110 motorcycles in May, 92 cars and 112 motorcycles in June and 62 cars and 89 motorcycles in July. In August, the citizens lost 58 cars and 103 motorcycles. ,When a senior police officer was asked why the police were reluctant to register FIRs of vehicle thefts, he told Dawn on condition of anonymity that since some of the vehicles were insured and leased from commercial banks, the victims expected the police to promptly register their FIRs so that they could get compensation from the leasing companies. “On the other hand, the police always seem reluctant to register the cases because the increase in the number of theft cases affects its performance.” ,He said sometimes people who had taken cars on lease and could not pay back the installments also try to lodge bogus FIRs to get rid of the payments. After getting the FIRs registered they submit claims and get their money back which they had already deposited with the leasing company, he added."

The issue is that rape survivors don’t speak up due to shame and lack of a support mechanism. We want to support them under this pilot project,” Neelam Turo, chairperson of the KPPCSW, told Dawn during a two-day consultation on the issues faced by such women.,The PCSW organised the event, which concluded on Wednesday, to design a KP-specific initiative on violence against women through a consultative process by bringing together stakeholders. ,Activist says such women disgraced at medicolegal examination centres, police stations and courts,The draft or outline was developed for the PCSW Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to initiate a pilot project to support and facilitate rape survivors in Peshawar.,The main partners for the initiative include Rozan, Foundation Open Society Institute Pakistan (FOSIP) and International Development Research Centre (IDRC). ,The consultation, which brought together researchers and practitioners from across the country, highlighted their findings on legal, medical and policing matters in cases of sexual crimes against women and follow-up discussions pointed out existing initiatives and gaps by practitioners and participants. ,Neelam Turo said the people discussed divorces, child marriages and domestic violence but ignored the serious issue of rape that had silenced many women.,“Women who have been raped feared coming out in the open to access justice due to stigma and hurdles they face at police stations, forensic labs during medic-legal examination and investigation,” she said.,Robina Naz, a member of PSCW and a lawyer, said women rape survivors were disgraced at medicolegal examination centres, police stations and courts and that they were unable to narrate their ordeal due to stigma. The entire environment is such that their rape case gets mishandled.,She said from registering an FIR at the police station to appearing in the courts, such women went through so much humiliation and that most of them often gave up in the middle.,“The courts should hold in-camera proceedings of such case so that a woman rape survivors could speak and present her case,” said Robina Naz.,She said judiciary in KP was gender-sensitive but from registration of FIR to investigation, a rape survivor case was often so weak and full of lacunas that such women went through hell while fighting for justice.,Farzana Bari, a researcher, highlighted how police being the face of the state was unable to help such survivors.,She said the police stations with very few women officers were places which women rape survivors feared contacting.,The chairs of the women commission at national level and Sindh and Punjab provinces discussed gaps and provided comprehensive recommendations for addressing issues related to lacunas in laws and its implementation, in policing, and in forensics.,Khawar Mumtaz, chairperson of the National Commission on the Status of Women and a rights activist, said the patriarchal mindset of the state and society was biggest hurdle to women survivors of violence.,She said trainings of police alone were not enough and that the rights activists needed to raise awareness of the issues with evidence and data.,She said instead of creating separate complaint or gender cells at various government departments, there was a need for cohesive effort and mechanism to help women victims of violence."

283,2017-09-29,Jirgas thrive in Karachi in clear defiance of state’s writ,"KARACHI: On Aug 14 this year, the day Pakistan turned 70, a teenage girl from Ali Brohi Goth, which is in the suburbs of Karachi and a 10-minute motorbike ride away from the more popular Ibrahim Hyderi, was , without any last rites performed for her. But then 15-year-old Bakht Taj didn’t deserve any such ceremony as she had brought dishonour to her Pashtoon tribe just like the 17-year-old-boy, Rehman, she had tried to elope with that day. ,A melting pot of nearly 15 million people from different religions and ethnicities, Karachi is perhaps like any other metropolis — a city of myriad contrasts. But behind its facade of tall buildings, parks, flyovers and underpasses, which give it a modern look, it manages to hide well some of the ugly customs and practices that have stealthily crept in with the migrants who have lately made it their home.,An example is the speedy jirgas (tribal councils) that are opposed vehemently by human rights groups who say they issue decrees that persecute women, minorities and the financially weaker members of the society. The state has deemed them unlawful since 2004, but they continue to hold sway and influence, and deliver edicts that are often accepted unequivocally. Even serving parliamentarians are often seen acting as arbitrators of justice and presiding over these jirgas. ,Every couple of months, the city reverberates with a horrific incident — usually when a jirga comes up with a particularly brutal way of teaching the condemned a lesson never to be forgotten. Like the latest murder of the two teenagers who ran away from home to get married but met a most vile and violent end.,Looking like a modern city, Karachi manages to hide many ugly practices that continue behind the scenes,And it has had the desired result. “My Pakhtun friends in that goth feel what happened to the couple can happen to them as well; they are quite scared,” said 23-year-old Mehran Shah, a university student residing in Ibrahim Hyderi. Shah, like the slain couple, believes that “if two adults want to get married, they should have this right; it is their life, after all”. But he said the youths’ family members thrust their choice on them. “If the latter resist, it becomes an issue of ego,” he added. ,The tribal council forced the parents of the young couple to kill them. But when the word got out, police arrested the fathers and uncles. During interrogation, the men revealed they had tortured the two with live electricity wires. The autopsy of the exhumed bodies carried out a month later confirmed this. ,The police are now in pursuit of some 30 members of the jirga who have fled the area. ,“What has really disturbed me is the severity of the murder,” said Maliha Zia Lari, associate director at the Karachi-based Legal Aid Society. ,Educationist Dr Pervez Hoodbhoy expressed similar views. “Such a gut-wrenching, barbaric murder of two young people in love should have brought thousands of protesters to streets. But no, large parts of Pakistani society still have plenty of tolerance for honour killings,” he said. ,Lari said that social pressures “to resort to traditional dispute resolution mechanisms” in the absence of effective law and order and governance mechanisms “result in increased use and impunity of jirgas”. ,Mohammad Ayub — a Pashtoon from Akora Khattak who has been living in Karachi for over 40 years — knows well about the jirgas taking place in the city. “People from the tribal areas are wary of going to courts where the cases go on forever. On the other hand, jirgas are able to give their verdict in just two days,” he said. “But they take a hefty amount in advance from both the parties and whichever side does not agree, their entire amount is confiscated. If their verdict is accepted, part of the advance is kept and the rest returned,” explained Ayub. ,He said that for most Pashtoons residing in the city disputes are resolved by the jirgas. “Sadly, women can never be part of jirgas or even have a say in the matter, even if it directly affects them,” added Ayub. ,Zohra Yusuf, former chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, said that upon hearing about the twin murders she felt a sense of “utter helplessness” when she realised that “our struggle is perhaps not producing the desired results”. ,But this case is rather different from the cases that one reads about in newspapers. What is unusual about it is the reluctance of the immediate families to carry out the ruthless verdict pronounced by the jirga and wanted to come to some settlement. ,“The boy’s father tried his best to convince the tribal council that he would pay Rs2 million to the father of the girl, as well give away a daughter as Swara,” said Kamal Shah of the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum, a non-governmental organisation working in the area. Swara, deemed a crime by the state, is the tradition of sending a woman from the family as gift to the aggrieved family to put an end to a feud. But the jirga rejected the settlement and warned that if the two families did not carry out the barbaric deed, their families back in their native villages would have to bear the wrath of the Taliban. ,""The event also highlights that the families may not want to participate in the punishment but are forced through social pressures,"" said Lari.,What is even more worrisome, she said, was that ""four laws were broken with impunity"" which include the child marriage restraint law, anti Swara laws, the anti-honour killing law and the anti-jirga. ""It is a critique on civil society"" that has for years been crying hoarse for this law and that but failed to work on ""changing social attitudes and mindsets"", she pointed out.,Given the propensity by the apex court to take matters in its hand, many look towards the Supreme Court to take suo motu notices when such crimes take place.,But Faisal Siddiqui, a Karachi-based lawyer finds court's intervention ""tedious"". ""The court can't be expected to take up every case; it doesn't have the capacity,"" he added.,Instead, he said, the onus lay on the Inspector General of the Sindh police, the local commissioner and the local MPA to do something about it. ""If these three join hands and strengthen each other, jirgas would never happen!"" he said.,University student Shah, finds the jirga system misplaced as it has ""caused more enmity than resolving conflicts"" and said mediation was a better tool. ""Mediators are independent unlike members of the jirga who can be biased towards one side,"" he said.,Mohammad Saeed, hailing from Bajaur, and working in Karachi for the last 15 years was also not in favour of jirgas, even in the tribal area as ""the verdict is hardly in favour of the poor and the weak"".,He had no clue that in February this year, a bill called Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) Bill-2016 was passed in the National Assembly. The law minister, Zahid Hamid, said the ADR system will settle 23 types of civil and criminal disputes.,Siddiqui said if properly regulated by court, these local adjudicating mechanisms can prove to be very effective, specially in settling tribal and family feuds. However, for crimes like honour killings and persecution of minorities, he said redressal should only be provided by the courts.,Lari, however, held a different opinion.

284,2017-09-29,SHC stays proceedings in Jamshoro 'blasphemy' case,"A division bench of the Sindh High Court's Hyderabad circuit on Friday stayed the proceedings in a case against four people who were booked on charges of blasphemy in Jamshoro a day earlier., (FIR) was registered under Section 295-A of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) against four people after a video clip surfaced showing a woman solemnising the marriage of a man and a woman under what was called ""Shariat-i-Latifi"".,The video showed a man, a Sindhi nationalist and follower of the Sufi saint Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai, getting the , of his daughter performed by a woman, declaring that this was being done under ‘Shariat-i-Latifi’.,Section 295-A of the PPC deals with ""deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs"", the punishment for which may be a fine or imprisonment for a period of up to 10 years, or both.,Besides the man, his daughter, the woman who performed the , and the groom had been named in the FIR.,As the father of the bride was taken into custody on Thursday, the woman seen solemnising the marriage in the video, represented by Advocate Sajjad Chandio, filed a constitutional petition in the SHC naming the Sindh home secretary, Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Bashir Ahmed Janwari, Senior Superintendent of Police Jamshoro Irfan Bahadur and District Inspector General Hyderabad Khadim Rind as respondents. ,The petitioner noted that ASI Janwari had lodged an FIR under Section 295-A of the PPC at the Khanot police station against her and three others. ,She argued that Section 295-A of the PPC relates to offences against the state, and that all offences against the state are tried under Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).,She further argued that the joint reading of offences under Section 196 of the CrPC and Section 295-A of the PPC therefore demonstrated that the offence, registered under Section 295-A PPC, was not an offence against an individual but against the state. ,Therefore, she maintained that the court could only take cognisance of the offence under Section 295-A PPC if the complaint was made or a case was registered under an order or by an authority of the federal or provincial government. ,She observed that in the present case, the complainant was neither the federal nor the provincial government, and that the home secretary was not authorised to act on their behalf to lodge an FIR or case, as no such authority letter had been recommended or mentioned in FIR No. 22/17.,The petitioner argued that the filing of the case by an individual in a personal capacity is of no legal consequence and is without substance, as the court could not take cognisance of the case if the complaint was not filed by or under the authority of the central or provincial government, according to the law laid down by the superior courts.,She urged the court to quash the FIR and stay proceedings of the case based on this defence.,The division bench, comprising Justice Salahuddin Panhwar and Justice Fahim Ahmed Siddiqui, subsequently restrained police officers from making any arrests in the matter.,The bench also issued notices to the respondents and the additional advocate general Sindh for Oct 30."

290,2017-10-01,Jail officials say CTD implicating them in ‘false’ case,"KARACHI: Jail authorities have questioned the mandate of the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of police to investigate a case against prison officials for their alleged role in the escape of two high-profile militants at a time when the CTD was also a complainant in the case, according to officials and documents obtained by Dawn on Saturday.,The jail authorities also accused the CTD police of implicating them in a “false case that is causing mental torture” to their officials. ,Such serious charges of the jail administration against the CTD prompted Inspector General of Police A.D. Khowaja to transfer the investigation of the latest case registered against the jail officials recently over charges of ‘obstructing’ the jailbreak probe.,On Sept 28, the CTD registered a fresh case (FIR No 157/2017) against the jail officials under Sections 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 109 (abetment) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.,Sindh IGP transfers investigation of case against present prison officials to Crime Branch ,“With the approval of competent authority (IGP), the investigation of case (FIR No. 157/2017 u/s 201/186/353/109/34-PPC r/w 7-ATA of PS CTD Operation District East) is hereby transferred Mr. Aftab Pathan, Addl. IGP Crime Branch Sindh for further investigation,” said an order issued by Additional IGP (Operations) Tanveer Odho.,It added that AIG Pathan would personally supervise the investigation of the case and depute a responsible officer for “early detection and impartial investigation on merit.”,This development came after filing of a written complaint by the present senior superintendent of Central Prison Karachi, Mohammad Hassan Sahito and other officials, which was submitted to the IGP through IG Prisons, according to the letter whose copy was obtained by Dawn.,The CTD authorities allegedly harassed and gave threats to jail officials from time to time for implicating them in false cases, according to the letter. They registered two more cases (FIR No 145/17, 157/17) at the CTD police station in addition to the third FIR (No 149/17) registered at the New Town police station against the present jail staff.,“Resultantly prison administration is upset, disappointed and shocked as to why they have been implicated in false and fabricated FIRs though they are performing duties with hard work and proper watch and vigilance.”,The jail officials said: “The act of CTD authorities will put ‘bad impact’ on all staff as no one will be willing to perform duties in prison and of course prisoners affiliated with different banned organisations as well as other high-profile hitmen of different political parties will take advantage of such prevailing chaos being initiated by the authorities of CTD.,“After the escape of two under-trial prisoners affiliated with banned organization, Lashkar-i-Jhangvi from ‘New Judicial Complex, adjacent to Central Prison Karachi’ on June 13, the prison administration is taking ‘drastic efforts continuously for last three months for restoration of prison writ/discipline among the prisoners and make the atmosphere of prison at its normal routine and as per rules.” ,Regarding demands of the CTD authorities to provide memory cards, knives, scissors etc seized during the search operation by the Rangers, the jail authorities in their letter contended that these confiscated items were in the custody of the Rangers authorities and this had been conveyed to the CTD investigators by the jail officials in writing.,The prison administration also claimed that they had ‘coordinated’ with the CTD investigators whenever the latter desired and never ‘concealed’ any document or evidence in this connection.,The jail officials also made it clear that no torture or threat had been given to any prisoner or staff to stop them from recording statements. “The CTD authorities frequently visited the prison and were allowed to meet any prisoner regarding investigation in separate place or room and they (jailers) always provided opportunities and made them free for the purpose.”,The prison administration argued that the CTD which was complainant in the case could not be investigator at the same time. “The CTD authorities are the complainant in the FIRs registered at the CTD police station and how can they investigate the case?” the letter stated.,The present jail officials urged the police chief through IG prisons for the ‘cancellation’ of the FIRs (No 145/17 and 157/17) or transfer of the investigation from the CTD to other police agencies in the three FIRs. The six jail officials, including senior superintendent, further asked the authorities to allow them to continue their work without ‘mental torture’.,In response to the serious allegations, CTD DIG Amir Farooqi said: “They [jailers] have not handed us things recovered during the jail search [by the Rangers]. Investigation is not moving forward. Whether we do investigation or someone else, it doesn’t matter. Important thing is that truth should be brought forward. We will put all things before court for them to decide.”"
291,2017-10-01,LEAs still clueless about 2009 Ashura blast suspects,"KARACHI: Law enforcement agencies have so far found no clue to the three suspected Jundullah militants who were allegedly involved in the 2009 Ashura bombing cases despite the passage of over seven years after their escape from the city courts.,The files of four cases pertaining to the targeted attacks on mourning processions, including the devastating bomb blast that ripped through the main Ashura procession killing more than 45 people on M.A. Jinnah Road in December 2009, have been gathering dust in an antiterrorism court as police and other special investigation units remained unable to trace the suspects who fled the courts.,Murtaza alias Shakil, Mohammad Saqib Farooqui, Wazir Mohammad and Murad Shah, said to be associated with banned militant outfit Jundullah, were arrested in January 2010 and booked in the four cases pertaining to a series of attacks on Muharram processions. But they were got freed from police custody by their accomplices after a gun attack on the city courts premises on June 20, 2010. One of the four suspects, Murad Shah, was killed while fleeing, but his accomplices were never caught again.,Following the escape, the police informed the anti-terrorism court (ATC-III) about it. Abating the legal proceedings in all the cases, the trial court issued life warrants for the arrest of the three suspects and directed the police to produce them in court as soon as possible. While the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) of police said they were high-profile criminals associated with the proscribed Jundullah, the suspects were not tried in court inside the prison and the jail authorities sent them to the city courts without making proper security arrangements.,It is the responsibility of investigating officers to ask or recommend the home department through a letter to notify jail trial of hardened criminals in high-profile cases or if the jail authorities had insufficient security arrangement to take them to courts.,Legal experts believed that prolonged suspension of the proceeding in such high-profile cases always benefited the accused party as prosecution witnesses might change their residence or go underground for fear. Also, it is hard for a witness to remember the exact evidence for years while it is also a difficult task for the investigating officers to maintain the case property, police files and stay in touch with their witnesses.,The SIU said that the suspected militants were arrested after a shoot-out on Hawkesbay Road on Jan 23, 2010 and claimed that they confessed to having carried out the attacks on the Muharram processions. ,They were charge-sheeted under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and their cases were sent to the ATC-III for trial and the court had supplied copies of documents to the suspects under Section 265-C of the criminal procedure code. However, they escaped before their indictment.,Murtaza and Saqib were booked for killing over 45 people and wounding about 100 others in the bomb attack on the main Ashura procession on Dec 28, 2009. The duo were also charge-sheeted in the Paposh Nagar blast that took place on Dec 26, 2009 (8th of Muharram) when a Muharram procession was passing by and it left 13 people wounded.,Murad Shah along with his absconding accomplices Haider, Hasnain and Sajid was charge-sheeted in a case pertaining to a low-intensity blast that targeted a 9th Muharram procession in Qasba Colony on Dec 27, 2009.,Besides, the four suspects were also booked in a case under Sections 4/5 of the Explosive Substance Act, 1908 read with Section 7 of the ATA at the Sir Syed police station, as the police claimed to have recovered explosive material on a lead provided by them."

They also told the CPO about the bribe allegedly received by the SHO.,The CPO ordered CIA SP to conduct a probe into the matter. ,During the inquiry, the SP was told by Sultan Bahawal of Chak 511-GB, Tandlianwala, whose land was situated near the spot of “encounter”, that the police brought Saqlain and Ramzan there in a van and asked them to run. ,When the two men refused to run, the police tied their hands and opened fire on them.,Munawar Shah told Dawn that police officers had been favouring the suspects in uniform and no action was taken against them. ,He said the case had been registered against the 17 suspects on the direction of the Lahore High Court (LHC). ,He said a judicial inquiry had also found the policemen guilty of killing Saqlain and Ramzan in a staged encounter. ,The SHO challenged the judicial inquiry report in the LHC but the court rejected his petition and directed Faisalabad police to register a case against 17 policemen, he added.,City Police Officer Athar Ismail said some of the policemen, including SHO Akram had been suspended from service, while some of the suspects had fled the country. ,He added that some of the suspects had been also been dismissed, while some other had retired from service. ,He admitted none of the suspects had been arrested so far."

He claimed that he also approached the Bahria Town office located on Murree Expressway, near Satra Meel. ,“I showed them the ownership documents, but they said the matter was not in their hands,” he said, adding that when he initially approached Bhara Kahu police to lodge a complaint, the station house officer and other officials refused to entertain him. ,He said that he had approached the district courts and filed a petition seeking the registration of a case. ,The complainant told the court that the property tycoon had illegally grabbed his inherited land and included it in his private housing scheme.,Mustafa Tanveer, counsel for Malik Riaz, told the court that the issue regarding the ownership of the land in question was pending before a civil court.,He alleged that the complainants had filed the petition for the registration of an FIR against Malik Riaz and his son in a bid to blackmail them, and argued that since the matter was pending before a civil court, criminal proceedings could not be initiated. ,In the order, however, the ADSJ observed that pendency of a civil suit is not a bar against criminal proceedings, as both can proceed simultaneously.,But in his order, the judge noted that it was not necessary to arrest an accused as soon as the FIR was registered, and directed that police should only take the accused into custody when a cognisable offence was proven during the course of the investigation.,“It is to be clarified here that when an FIR is registered it is not necessary that in all cases the accused should be arrested. The accused may be arrested only in those cases where sufficient evidence comes on record against the accused,” the order read. ,Moreover, “if during investigation, the information provided by the petitioner is proved false, local police may initiate strict proceedings under Section 182 (invoked against false accusers) of Pakistan Penal Code against the informant for providing false information”, the order further states. ,When contacted, Bahria Town spokesperson retired Col Mohammad Khalil told Dawn that the housing society had lawfully purchased the land in question. ,He admitted there was a minor dispute between the society and locals, adding that the case was pending before a civil court in Islamabad. ,However, he alleged that locals had filed an application seeking the registration of an FIR against Bahria Town high-ups with mala fide intent, to pressure the housing society into giving them a better deal.

The incident was confirmed by police in the area on Sunday.,“The innocent child was ruthlessly beaten. Who resorts to such kind of torturous treatment with schoolchildren in today’s time?” Qazi Arsalan, second officer in Police Station Abbaspur, told ,.,According to the police, the incident occurred on Tuesday and garnered local attention after human rights activist Saqib Mushtaq uploaded photographs of the girl on Facebook. ,Pictures showed the bruised swollen eyes of the girl, which doctors say is because of flogging on the head. Marks of flogging were also seen on the girl's back.,According to Arsalan, the girl was brought to the station by her grandfather and uncle on Wednesday ─ a day after the incident took place. ,The police sent to her to a local health facility, from where she was referred to Shaikh Khalifa bin Zayed al- Nahayan Hospital in district headquarters Rawalakot. ,“Since there is no such law in AJK dealing with corporal punishment in educational institutions, we were left with no choice but to register a case under normal penal code sections, which however require a medical report,” Arsalan explained.,On Saturday, the police received a provisional medical report from Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahayan Hospital, on the basis of which a first information report (FIR) was lodged against the teacher, he said. ,“Police teams are conducting raids to arrest the accused but she has gone into hiding,” he said, adding that the case was assigned to a lady sub-inspector.,Separately on Saturday, Deputy Commissioner Poonch Raja Tahir Mumtaz constituted an official committee and ordered it to submit a report regarding the incident within three days.

Rather, she was “unlawfully” serving in place of the regular teacher when the incident took place.,Under a troublesome practice, allegedly carried out in connivance with education department officials, teachers appoint “surrogates” in their place against a nominal salary.,“If it’s proven that she is not a duly appointed teacher, we will also add a section in the FIR dealing with impersonation,” he said. “We will also write to the concerned authorities to bring those officials to justice who had turned a blind eye towards this unlawful practice."",Meanwhile, the incident drew wrath and indignation from across AJK on social networks.,“The more we condemn this incident, the less it will be. It’s not punishment but savagery. Such ogres should be banned forever from serving in this noble profession,” one user wrote on his Facebook account regarding the incident. “The education department should take solid steps to stop recurrence of such incidents."",Another user lamented that majority of teachers in AJK were not playing the role that their profession warranted.,“There are very few teachers [who are] seriously and sincerely interested in education as well as training of students. Many [teachers] resort to corporal punishment to bring students to terms which eventually divests victims of interest in studies,” he maintained."

However, despite the lapse of a decade, the aggrieved family did not move even a single application for exhumation, he maintained. ,The officers challenged their sentence on the grounds that there was no evidence of their active participation in the terrorist attack. The prosecution could not prove any mens rea (the intention or knowledge of wrongdoing that constitutes part of a crime, as opposed to the action or conduct of the accused) against them."

309,2017-10-06,"Mr President, how can you hang a man who cannot even stand?"," ,I married Abdul Basit in 2002. He was an administrative assistant at a local medical college, handsome, and promised me a good future. He liked to wear good clothes, and loved cologne. We had two sons. Today, they are 13 and nine.,My eldest son has known his father for only the first four years of his life. The younger one was barely a year old when Basit left us.,His arrest was sudden, to say the least. He has always maintained his innocence for the murder that saw him sentenced to death in 2009. A gun was fired in the middle of an altercation, with the family of a woman he knew.  ,We don’t know who shot it. Basit insists that it was not him. I believe, in my heart, that he is right. He had no reason to kill that man. We were stable, we were happy and Basit was neither angry nor violent.,But a man did die, and Basit was arrested for it. When he went to jail, we had no idea what hit us. It was only me and Basit’s mother, facing a judicial system we did not understand, and a lawyer who was only interested in money.,And everything cost far more than we could afford. Getting to the courthouse – which was four hours away in Okara District, would cost us a few thousand rupees just in travel costs. Then there were the lawyer’s fees and the demands of the policemen themselves.,There were days when I did not have money to buy milk for my infant son and I would dissolve sugar in water, and feed him through a bottle. He would cry. But eventually he would sleep, even if I would not be able to.,We were two women with little understanding of our rights, and unsure about whom to turn to for help. To make matters worse, we were harassed and abused by our opponents, every time we appeared at the court. ,They would warn us to not show up at the next hearing, following us all the way to the bus stop. They would tell me that they would kidnap my sons if I did not heed their warnings.,We were alone, poor, female and so, easy targets.,I thought that was it. That his death sentence was a death sentence for all of us.,But Basit was not done being punished. He had spent the first 18 months of his detention in Sahiwal Jail, before being transferred to Central Jail, Faisalabad in 2010. ,In August, I received a phone call from the jail hospital. Basit was in a coma, and we were told that in all likelihood, he would not wake up again. Perhaps we should come say goodbye.,How had this happened? Riots had broken out in the prison, to protest the use of use of torture by the jail authorities. Basit, and many other inmates were confined to a “punishment wing,” a small room in filthy conditions. He became ill, collapsed and received medical attention too late.,When we got to the hospital, we were told that he had tubercular meningitis. He would never walk again as a result.,He lies like a corpse in his bed, directly as a result of jail negligence.,			
,And if that wasn’t humiliation enough, the Government of Pakistan issued two execution warrants for him after he was paralysed. The only reason Basit is alive today (if even barely) is simply because prison authorities do not know how to hang a man who is unable to stand. What they hope to gain from hanging a cripple is beyond me.,Each time I visit him in prison I see how he is deteriorating, but there is nothing I can do for him. When we meet, when he speaks, he makes little sense and barely recognises me. He is also in considerable pain, and of course, the conditions of the prison only make matters worse.,I feel tired. The burdens have increased – the rent, the children’s school fees, their private tuition costs, and the general cost of living is making things harder. I have two jobs now just to keep things going, keep my head above water. ,I worry about the boys – not having a father has adversely affected them. They are reserved and silent. People talk, and I know the children hear.,So a healthy, fully able man walked into a jail – and today, he requires a catheter, and prison authorities to regularly turn him to prevent bed sores. To the guards, for all intents and purposes, Basit is nothing more than a heap of inconvenient flesh.,If this isn’t grounds for mercy, I’m not sure what else is., , "

They carried banners inscribed with slogans such as ‘Enough is enough’, ‘Attacks on women unacceptable’, ‘Arrest the culprit’, ‘Protect women, or quit.’,The protesters also criticised the alleged “incompetence” of the provincial government, particularly that of the home minister of Sindh., ,Police authorities have set up two teams to investigate the attacks on women and arrest the attacker.,City police chief Mushtaq Ahmed Mahar said that one team was headed by the CIA DIG and the other by the DIG of East Zone.,“Karachi police are trying their best and have deputed many teams for the arrest of the person/persons involved in these heinous offences to create panic and fear,” the Karachi AIG said. “The person involved is most likely a psychopath.” ,He added that the police were working on a “few available clues” and persons involved in previous similar cases were being probed., ,The city police chief urged the media to exercise caution while covering such attacks on women.,He requested the media to report the incidents but not to “sensationalise” them. Mr Mahar said police had arrested high-profile target killers and terrorists in the past. He hoped that this case would also be solved. ,“I appeal to citizens of Karachi not to panic and provide information related to the incident,” he said."
313,2017-10-08,Danish police find decapitated head of Swedish journalist,"COPENHAGEN: Danish police said on Saturday that divers had recovered the decapitated head and the legs of Swedish journalist Kim Wall, who vanished in August while interviewing a Danish inventor aboard his homemade submarine.,In a grisly case worthy of a Nordic noir thriller, Copenhagen police inspector Jens Moller Jensen told reporters that divers had found bags containing her missing clothes, her head and legs in Koge Bay, south of the Danish capital.,“Last night our forensic dentist confirmed that it was Kim Wall’s head,” he said.,Her headless torso was found floating in waters off Copenhagen on August 21, 11 days after she went missing.,Self-taught engineer and inventor Peter Madsen, 46, has been accused of Wall’s death, with prosecutors saying he dismembered her body before throwing it overboard.,Madsen, who is married and has been in custody since August 11, claims Wall died when a 70-kilo hatch door fell on her head, and in a panic, he threw her body overboard. He has insisted her body was intact at the time.,But Jensen said the decapitated head contradicted Madsen’s version of events.,There is “no sign of fracture on the skull and there isn’t any sign of other blunt violence to the skull,” he said, citing an autopsy carried out overnight.,Locating Wall’s head has been a priority for investigators, as the final autopsy on the torso was not able to establish the cause of death. However, it did show multiple mutilation wounds to Wall’s genitals.,Prosecutors believe Madsen killed 30-year-old Wall as part of a sexual fantasy, then dismembered and mutilated her body. Earlier this week, prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen told a court custody hearing that a hard disk found in Madsen’s workshop contained fetish films in which real women were tortured, decapitated and burned.,“This hard drive doesn’t belong to me,” Madsen insisted, saying numerous people had access to his workshop."
314,2017-10-08,"Data collected through geofencing, Punjab police approached to help arrest ‘knifeman’","KARACHI: The Sindh police stepped up their efforts to arrest the “lone knifeman” attacking women in Gulistan-i-Jauhar and Gulshan-i-Iqbal as the investigators on Saturday collected data through geofencing at nine different spots of the two towns and acquired details from their counterparts in Punjab who tracked down culprits in almost the same case some two years ago in Sahiwal, officials said.,The move to collect cellular communication data through geofencing came a day after Sindh IG A.D. Khowaja directed his team to use technological assistance for the attacker’s arrest after two-week conventional probe failed to achieve a breakthrough. The points selected by the investigators for geofencing were marked by the respective police stations which received complaints from women victims, said an official.,‘Police only detained some young motorcycle riders and released them after initial inquiries’ ,“There are a total of nine places initially selected for this purpose and we hope that this exercise will help,” he said. “It may take time to analyse such data acquired through this exercise but it has been quite effective in previous investigations. Intelligence on ground and physical presence of the personnel in the areas — both in uniform and civvies — plus such technological support would hopefully lead to the desired results.”,The fresh move by the investigators would add to their efforts for the suspect’s arrest as nothing positive has emerged so far. The incidents have not only emerged as a serious challenge for the police but also provided space to political parties to question the Pakistan Peoples Party government’s effectiveness. The hype created by the broadcast media has fanned speculation and triggered more fear in the two neighbourhoods.,“An SSP-rank officer with his team has met officers in the Punjab police, who had resolved almost the same case in 2015. Those findings would further help [track] the trend here in Karachi. No arrest has, however, been made yet. The police only detained some young motorcycle riders and released them after initial inquiries,” said the official.,The police have announced a Rs500,000 reward for anyone who may give information leading to arrest of the culprit(s) and Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has separately announced a matching sum as a reward for the attacker’s arrest.,Meanwhile, the central police office officially released more sketches of the suspect, asking the people to help the investigators trace him. The fresh images showed two different motorbikes and in one incident the attacker is wearing shalwar-kameez.,“The police are releasing pictorial sketches for awareness and cooperation from the public,” said a brief statement issued by the Sindh police spokesman. “The physical description and maximum details gathered from witnesses and CCTV (closed-circuit television) cameras have been given. The police presence has been enhanced in the area in various formats. The people are requested to cooperate with the police.” "

And for that purpose we are engaging Punjab University’s Dean of Social Sciences Dr Zakaria Zakir, requesting him to find out why people in the district bordering India are indulging in sexual assault on boys and murdering them,” said Lahore Commissioner Abdullah Sumbal on Sunday. ,Kasur gained worldwide attention after media reported endemic sexual assaults on boys in a village in 2015. The culprits were arrested and are being tried. ,Mr Sumbal said the incidents in the district never stopped. First such cases were reported from within Kasur city and later Pattoki, bordering Okara district, and Ganda Singhwala located at the Pakistan-India border. Around eight assaulted boys were also murdered in the last one year. ,The home department had taken serious notice of the incidents when they were reported with officials questioning their reason, sources said. Senior officials of the prosecution and social welfare department were also consulted. ,Finally, the Lahore commissioner recently called a meeting which was attended by officials of these departments and the Kasur deputy commissioner. ,During the meeting, it was revealed that there was no office of Child Protection Bureau in Kasur. Surprised, the commissioner directed its immediate establishment, and the deputy commissioner has reportedly started work on the office in the District Complex. ,The meeting decided to engage a clinical psychologist from the Kasur DHQ hospital to counsel the culprits as well as victims. ,It was learnt that the Kasur district social welfare office was not performing to its optimal level due to lack of resources and capacity building, and there was an institutional gap between it and the Child Protection Bureau. ,The social welfare secretary told Dawn that the office was now being equipped to deliver to the required level. It was also approaching the Punjab University for investigation into sociological causes of the crime.,It was decided to create awareness among people so as to discourage the crime and teach parents how to protect their children, utilising services of health field staff, including lady health visitors, polio and dengue teams. Ulema of peace committees, mosques, seminaries, and the field staff of agriculture, livestock and auqaf departments should also be engaged for the purpose. ,The deputy commissioner was asked to notify a district coordination committee comprising all departments concerned for further deliberations on the issue. The Kasur district police officer was asked to appoint a focal person for liaison with the prosecution department so as to ensure speedy punishment of culprits."

Fourth schedulers are also bound to submit a three-year surety bond to their concerned police station guaranteeing their peaceful conduct.,City police chief says no SOP regarding placement of terrorism suspects on watch list,The officer urged that the names of individuals, who had been arrested in terrorism cases but had been released from prison, should be placed on schedule four of the ATA, since such people needed to be kept under strict surveillance, lest they commit any further criminal acts.,However, City Police Officer Israr Ahmed Abbasi told Dawn that there was no standard operating procedure (SOP) in place to put the name of every individual who had been arrested in terrorism cases and then released, on the fourth schedule list.,“The divisional intelligence committee (DIC), depending on the nature of the case and the background of the accused, decides whether to place a suspect’s name on the fourth schedule,” he said. ,“Those individuals who had been acquitted by the court and whose names are not placed on the exit control list are allowed to travel abroad.”,One of the men was acquitted by an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in 2011, and has been missing from his home in Rawalpindi’s Quaid-e-Azam Colony since July 2013. ,Another individual released from Adiala Jail in May 2009 has been in Saudi Arabia ever since.,Sources said that a third individual, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison in a terrorism case in 2004 but later released after the completion of his sentence, is also in Saudi Arabia.,Another suspect, who was arrested by Aabpara police and later booked in terrorism-related cases, was acquitted by the ATC court in 2010 and 2011.

320,2017-10-10,Karachi’s serial ‘knifeman’ unleashes collective fear,"KARACHI: “I was walking with my children to a relative’s house when I felt a hand on the back of my thigh. I was shocked and froze — with anger and embarrassment — as the motorcyclist sped away. Cursing the eve-teaser, I hurriedly entered the house and it was when I felt pain in my thigh area. My clothes were wet with blood,” recollects Mrs Arif. ,A housewife and mother of three kids, she is one of the victims of the Karachi knife attacker who has so far injured more than 10 women in two weeks and has managed to elude the police. ,“It was a thin man wearing a red and black helmet and off-white shalwar kameez on a motorbike,” she recalls. “I was wearing a big, thick shawl that night and it saved me from severe injuries,” she adds.,Despite the passage of several days since the attack, she admits she is still shaken. “I feel unsafe stepping out alone. The worst part of this attack has been the media frenzy. TV reporters showed up, asking how I felt. My nine-year old daughter is so traumatised,” she says.,‘You can’t search every bike rider in a city of 20 million’,Mrs Arif’s account is corroborated by another victim. A student of class VII, 14-year-old ‘T’ was walking to a shop with her mother and brother when the attack happened. “I felt someone’s hand slapped my hip. I cringed and hurried but then I was overcome with pain in my upper leg, as blood gushed out,” says T. ,Yet another victim’s brother narrated a similar ordeal. “My sister was touched on her lower body and the next thing she realised she was bleeding,” he says. ,Pakistan has had its fair share of violent serial attacks. The infamous Hathora group and Chhalawa gang terrorised Karachiites in the ’80s and ’90s, known for smashing the skulls of their victims. ,In the late ’90s, there were reports of men with ustra/blade slashing the arms of women wearing short-sleeved shirts outside a major Karachi shopping mall. ,Back in 2007, it was the killing of Punjab minister Zille Huma that shocked the country. Her killer was not happy with her clothing. ,In 2012, a rickshaw driver in Karachi used to pick up women passengers, disembody them and throw away their body parts. While in 2016, news reports surfaced that a man was stabbing women in Rawalpindi. ,Similar to the Karachi attacks, a series of similar knife attacks were reported between 2013 and 2016 in Punjab’s Sahiwal district. ,“Almost 40 women were attacked in Chichawatni by a man on a motorbike using a sharp paper cutter,” says DIG East Sultan Khowaja. ,Waseem, the alleged attacker from Punjab, was released on bail last year. He has been declared an absconder and is wanted for the attacks. ,“His goal is to create fear and unrest,” the DIG adds. ,“The injuries and areas of attacks are all similar. He attacks them on the lower part of the body — near the waist, hip and thighs. He controls the speed of his bike with the right hand and uses the left hand for attacks,” he elaborates. ,Information obtained from police and hospitals shows almost all women suffered injuries on their right side and were attacked from behind. ,“He is attacking women — young and old alike. He hasn’t shown any preference for women dressed in particular attire.” ,The general feeling of unease and anger amongst the citizens is increasing. Working women acknowledged feeling overwhelmed and scared, many opting for rickshaws and cab services and not walking to bus stops. Female students of Karachi University and Habib University are avoiding walking alone. ,MPA Sharmila Farooqui says that these attacks have traumatised women. ,“So far the attacks are limited to one district and this is a good sign. Get the Rangers onboard. Search every motorcyclist in the area, have 24/7 patrolling and most importantly form mohalla committees to keep an eye on anyone suspicious,” she stresses. ,Dr Sameeha Aleem, a consultant psychiatrist, says “Collective fear is being instilled.,“Many families have restricted the movements of women and girls to avoid any attacks but this is not a solution,” she explains. ,She elaborates that some of her female patients have expressed anxiety since the attacks have been reported and are showing worsening symptoms, including panic attacks. ,Dr Aleem speculates the knifeman might be receiving commanding hallucinations to attack women if he has a psychotic disorder. ,“He could also be an individual who has witnessed violence and abuse at the hands of women and is now revengeful,” she conjectures. ,While the attacker plays hide-and-seek with the authorities, citizens hope for his quick arrest. ,“The real issue here is that these are all surprise attacks,” says security adviser Norbert Almeida. “He catches his victims by surprise — coming from behind, slashing them and then speeding away.” ,However, he too says that it’s safe to believe it is one person at the moment. ,“But in a city of 20 million, you can’t stop every single person on a bike and check for a weapon. That is the challenge the police faces,” he says."

326,2017-10-12,Untold stories from prison,"KARACHI: World Day Against the Death Penalty on Tuesday was observed at the Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture with the performance of Intezar, an open-air interactive play organised by Justice Project Pakistan, Azad Theatre and Highlight Arts. The performance follows after a week-long campaign titled ‘Bus Kar Do’, which saw activists travelling by bus to spread awareness about the issue all the way from Lahore to Karachi. ,The collective stories of several individuals that started from jail and ended at the gallows and the people associated with them in one way or the other raises several questions. There was the poor mother who arrived from afar to collect her son’s remains after his hanging; there is also the older brother who was there from Azad Kashmir for the same purpose, waiting for his brother to be hanged, younger by 10 years, but who now looked 10 years older. And inside the prison there were many other inmates on death row whose stories need to be told. ,No matter if they are guilty or innocent, it’s the system that has landed them there and exposed them to all kinds of injustices such as police brutality and such torture during investigation that it made Shagufta, a sane girl, lose her mental balance. Sixteen-year-old Owais accused of kidnapping and murder admits to the crime and also that he is not a minor but 23 years old, but only after being subjected to extreme torture by the police. ,An artist, sketching and painting away to while away his time as his family runs from pillar to post to find him justice by hiring bigger lawyers and appealing to higher courts; a professor who takes it upon himself to make others around him literate enough to not sign anything that may go against them legally; these are just some of the stories portrayed. ,One by one, they all receive their death warrants. Some get stay orders, some succumb to their fate as the others tell them not to worry as they too will follow them soon to the gallows. Meanwhile, the lawyers do what they do.,Among them are also the passionate ones who manage to save lives, like the life of the invalid inmate who could not even walk himself to the gallows and was saved on that technicality after which it was realised that he may also be innocent of the crime he is said to have committed. ,The executioner, too, doesn’t know how to live with himself. There is one who has hanged 300 people and received Rs300 bonus for each along with his regular salary. But he can’t sleep at night as he has nightmares in which the spirits of the executed prisoners keep dragging him to the gallows. ,All the characters in the play are based on real people.

In Multan many voiced their outrage that innocent people remain in danger of being executed. In Sukkur, the local union council leader explicitly announced to the crowd that they had not forgotten the hanging of Bhutto and that the government remains aware that the system is unjust against the impoverished. In Hyderabad, Intezar was staged in front of the press club, right in the middle of the street.,In order to measure the impact of the above performances, the organisers also asked members of their audiences to write postcards to President Mamnoon Hussain, asking for clemency for death row inmates that do not deserve to be executed. ,Head of communications at Justice Project Pakistan, Rimmel Mohydin said that ‘Bus Kar Do’ has literally brought untold stories from prisons across Pakistan to the streets, and with it nuance and empathy for some of our most demonised citizens. “With acts as simple as writing a postcard or taking a selfie, people are joining our call to bring back the moratorium,” she said."

He reportedly provided cover to Waseem, who came to Karachi about a month ago. The police said Waseem had been missing from his native village 86/6-R for the last six months. ,Shahzad told the police that Waseem was suffering from some psychological disorder and the media coverage of his acts gave him solace. ,Besides the alleged facilitator, the police had detained 38 suspects for questioning during raids and search operations, said Karachi-East SSP Dr Samiullah Soomro. ,“One or two detained persons were paramedics as the suspect used a scalpel, which is used in medical surgeries, to attack women.

Both boys recorded Hasnain being bundled into the trunk and uploaded it on Snapchat. When Hasnain could not come out of the trunk in the given time, the other two got him out. His condition was stable.” ,The FIA initially took all three boys into custody, but set them free without registering a first information report against them after recording their and their parents’ statements. ,“Since no crime has been committed by the boys, we allowed them to go home after conducting a counselling session with them and their parents,” Mr Usman added. ,Suleman told FIA that they were good friends and were inspired by different games on social media, including Blue Whale Challenge. ,“On Monday, my friends Hasnain and Hamza came to my house and played an online game. It showed how a man tied and locked inside a car’s trunk manages to free himself within two-and-a-half minutes. I asked my friends who will take up this challenge and Hasnain accepted it. The mistake we committed was uploading the video that went viral and we paid for it by being here (FIA),” Suleman said in a statement. ,“Parents must keep an eye on their children in this digital age. Allowing them to keep smartphones at a tender age exposes children to such dangerous trends on social media,” FIA Punjab Director Dr Usman Anwar told Dawn. ,The response by Interpol Washington within no time has proved that all activity on social media is being “strictly monitored”, an official believed. ,Last month, two college girls in Jhelum were expelled after they cut their arms using a knife while allegedly playing the Blue Whale Challenge.

359,2017-10-20,In the interest of justice,"AFTER nearly three years of state-sanctioned violence during which 465 condemned prisoners have been put to death, any move in the opposite direction is welcome news. ,Possibly under pressure from Western countries and international human rights bodies — although one hopes also from a desire to serve the ends of justice — Pakistan has decided to review the scope of the death penalty and consider reducing the number of capital offences. ,Having recently been elected member of the UN Human Rights Council, and with its Universal Periodic Review coming up, Pakistan could certainly do with one blot less on its dismal human rights record. ,At present, there are 27 crimes in the country that are punishable by death: among these are offences such as railway sabotage, drug smuggling and arms trafficking.  ,There has never been a considered debate about the death penalty in Pakistan, only an emotional response framed in binary terms. ,The very lifting of the moratorium on capital punishment following the APS Peshawar attack on December 2014 was a knee-jerk reaction to a gut-wrenching event. ,For a state on the back foot, faced with a furious, grieving public, the quickest way to appear in control of a rapidly unravelling security situation was to execute some of the approximately 8,000 prisoners on death row as a form of ‘instant retribution’. ,This became a pattern in Punjab — the province that carried out 83pc of all executions during this period — where hangings spiked in the immediate aftermath of terrorist attacks. ,Moreover, although the lifting of the moratorium, at least after the initial months, affected both those convicted of terrorism-related offences and those on death row for other capital crimes, only 16pc of executed prisoners had been convicted in the anti-terrorism courts — further evidence that the hangings were little more than a populist measure. ,It stands to reason then that the decline in terrorist attacks has been on account of effective military action, rather than capital punishment acting as a deterrent, a theory anyway long debunked by multiple studies. ,No debate about the death penalty is complete without considering the appalling state of the criminal justice system in Pakistan. ,Unlike the privileged few who have the means to engage expensive legal counsel, the vast majority of litigants are at the mercy of state-appointed counsel too overburdened to provide a proper defence to those whose lives are on the line. ,Shocking miscarriages of justice have come to light recently: prisoners executed before their appeals process had even been completed; juveniles sent to the gallows, death warrants issued for the physically infirm and the mentally ill, etc. ,There have also been several cases where prisoners on death row have been acquitted after spending years behind bars. ,That, if nothing else, is the most compelling argument against the final, irrevocable act of taking a person’s life."

371,2017-10-22,Return of ‘missing’ journalist,"THE first reaction to the return home of , is of course one of relief. ,The young Lahore-based journalist was abducted by armed men on Aug 19, 2015, while on her way to work. At the time, she had been pursuing the case of an Indian national, Hamid Ansari, who had gone missing in 2012 after being arrested for crossing illegally into Pakistan from Afghanistan. ,After getting in touch with his family in Mumbai, Ms Shahzadi had filed a habeas corpus petition in the Peshawar High Court as well as applications with the Supreme Court’s Human Rights Cell and the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances. ,It was rather ironic — although not unprecedented in Pakistan — that she herself soon became a ‘missing’ person. According to CoIoED, Ms Shahzadi was recovered from the Pak-Afghan border and that “anti-state elements and anti-Pakistan secret agencies” had been involved in her disappearance.,However, following relief over her safe recovery, there should be a groundswell of anger. Anger that apparently the most that the public and the authorities — specifically the courts and CoIoED — can now hope for is that the missing return unharmed.,Disregarding all protests of civil society, the theatre of enforced disappearances has not only expanded from Balochistan to the rest of the country, especially Sindh, but it has also become more brazen, with abductions taking place even in broad daylight in urban centres. Journalists, rights activists, social workers — anyone it seems is a viable target. Several still remain missing. ,There is no doubt that Pakistan, like most other countries, must remain vigilant against subversive elements, but the state, in complete violation of constitutionally protected rights, has evidently expanded the definition of ‘subversion’ to include any citizen critical of its policies or seeking for it to be held accountable. The circumstances of Ms Shahzadi’s disappearance and ‘recovery’, the threats she had received prior to her abduction and the fact there was no ransom demand during her captivity, raise questions that lend themselves to but one conclusion. ,Meanwhile, the CoIoED, set up six years ago by the government as a “landmark achievement” has proven a toothless and ineffectual body with neither the resources, inclination nor power to do more than document cases of enforced disappearances. ,In not a single instance has it held the perpetrators to account. ,Last but not least, Ms Shahzadi’s case has also highlighted the suffering of the families of the missing in a particularly tragic way. Her brother, unable to cope with her continued absence, committed suicide last year. ,That is a loss she can never be compensated for. Moreover, a journalist like this young woman, committed to actually seeking out the truth rather than acting as a passive observer, would be an asset in a civilised society. But then, Pakistan would have had to be a different country. "

375,2017-10-23,Journalist’s recovery brings Indian prisoner’s case into focus,"Like her abduction from Lahore, the , after over two years of captivity has given birth to several questions due to unavailability of related information. ,The issue of her kidnapping, which is considered by human rights activists a case of “enforced disappearance”, had assumed international importance as she was pursuing the disappearance of an Indian national, Hamid Nehal Ansari, from Kohat district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2012. ,Subsequently, after her kidnapping the government agencies had admitted that the missing Indian was in their custody and was later on convicted by a court martial and sentenced to three years imprisonment. ,Her release has again brought into focus the plight of Mr Ansari, presently imprisoned at Mardan Central Prison. ,He has recently filed a writ petition in PHC, seeking remission in his prison term. ,According to the prison record, his imprisonment of three years is being counted from Dec 15, 2015, the day of his conviction. ,He was not given remission as the prison authorities state that on his jail warrant the word “anti-state activities” is written in the column of charges. ,Mr Ansari has stated in his petition that no evidence was produced against him in respect of his involvement in anti-state activities. ,“I had not come to Pakistan for commission of anti-state activities, but to meet a female with whom friendship was developed on facebook,” he claimed, adding that he was neither an Indian agent nor had any connection with any group working against Pakistan. ,Zeenat Shahzadi, who was declared her attorney by Ansari’s mother Fauzia Ansari, was seen relentlessly pursing the case of Mr Ansari before the Peshawar High Court as well as the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances (COIED). ,It was the National Accountability Bureau’s chairman retired Justice Javed Iqbal, a former judge of the Supreme Court serving for last many years as the COIED’s chairman, who has reportedly confirmed the recovery of Zeenat Shahzadi on Oct 19. ,Several media outlets have quoted Mr Iqbal as saying that Ms Shahzadi was recovered on the night of Oct 10 from near the Pak-Afghan border. ,He had reportedly said that some non-state actors and enemy agencies had kidnapped her and she was recovered from them. ,He had claimed that tribal elders in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa played an important role in her recovery. ,No further details are available as both Ms Shahzadi and her family are apparently incommunicado and her residence in Lahore was found locked by mediapersons. ,Her kidnap and recovery both had given birth to questions like: Who had taken her away? Was her kidnapping linked with the case of Mr Ansari? Whether she was set free by her captors on certain conditions or recovered from custody? How her captors had taken her away to the border area? ,Ms Shahzadi had gone missing on Aug 19, 2015, when she was taken away by armed men while she was travelling in an auto-rickshaw. ,The occurrence took place a few days before she had to appear before COIED in the complaint regarding Mr Ansari. ,The most tragic aspect of her kidnapping was that one of her brothers, Saddam, who family members claimed was disturbed due to her disappearance, had committed suicide in March 2016. ,Her supporters mostly believe that her abduction had linkage with the case of Mr Ansari. ,Mr Ansari, 32, had gone missing after his illegal entry into Pakistan from Afghanistan in Nov 2012 and was subsequently traced in custody of security forces in Jan 2016. ,He was a teacher at Mumbai Management College. ,He claims that he had left India for Afghanistan on Nov 4, 2012 on a valid tourist visa. He left Jalalabad for Peshawar on Nov 12, 2012 and entered Pakistan with a fake identity card in the name of Hamza sent to him by one of his facebook friends from Karak, with whom he stayed in Karak for two days. ,He added that on Nov 14, 2012, his friend left him at a hotel in Kohat following which he was arrested and taken away by officials of an intelligence agency. ,For over three years the whereabouts of Mr Ansari could not be traced. ,His mother had filed a habeas corpus petition in the high court, which was disposed of on Jan 13, 2016, when it was informed through a written reply by the ministry of defence that Mr Ansari is in military’s custody and being tried by court martial. ,Later, a writ petition was filed on behalf of Mr Ansari seeking different reliefs, including fair treatment and protection in the prison and relief under Section 382-B of the Code of Criminal Procedure. ,That petition was disposed of on Nov 1, 2016, by the high court with the observation that providing him benefit of section 382-B CrPC was between the prison and military authorities. ,Under the said section, the period of detention of a convict before his conviction is considered in his prison term. ,The ministries of defence and foreign affairs, in their joint comments, had stated that the petitioner was involved in espionage/anti- state activities and he was subject to the Pakistan Army Act, therefore, the jurisdiction of high court was ousted in this case. ,Mr Ansari and his mother denied the allegations of his involvement in anti-state activities and had claimed that he had befriended on the facebook and became close to a Pakistani girl. ,They claimed that he had reached Kohat in an attempt to save this Facebook friend from forced marriage by her family.,In his present petition, Mr Ansari has requested the court to issue appropriate directions to the ministry of defence to amend the jail warrant and substitute the word “anti-state activities” by illegal activities. ,He has further prayed to issue directions to the jail authorities to allow the due remission to him with effect from Dec 15, 2015, and work out his date of release after allowing remission."

378,2017-10-24,Former hockey team goalkeeper to pursue harassment case alone after PHF shuts its doors,"			
,Former goalkeeper for the women's national hockey team Syeda Sadia, who has accused the team's head coach, Saeed Khan, of harassment and assault, told , on Tuesday that she will pursue a case against Khan independently as the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) seems unwilling to take any action against him.,""I will definitely pursue a case. When it comes down to my respect, I cannot tolerate it. I will not sit quietly,"" Sadia said speaking to , over the phone on Monday. ,Sadia, who also captains the Railways hockey team, has alleged that Khan harassed and assaulted her on the night of October 8. ,Recalling the events of that night, Sadia said she had been attending a dinner being hosted for players at the hockey federation's facilities in Lahore when the team coach, who had been ""glaring at her throughout the night"", asked her to step outside the dining hall. ,Once outside, Khan allegedly spoke to Sadia in a harsh tone and grabbed her , (scarf). He allegedly raised his hand to hit her as well. ,It was at this moment, Sadia said, that Tanzeela Aamer, secretary of the PHF's women's wing, walked out, saw the altercation, and stopped Khan from hitting her.,""Tanzeela ma'am then went back to the dinner. I ran back to my hostel room and he [Khan] followed me there,"" Sadia said. ,Iqra Javed, another player on the hockey team, was in the room at the time, getting ready for the dinner. ,Sadia alleged that once in the room, Khan grabbed her arm and threatened to ban her — and Iqra, when she tried to stop him — if they spoke out against him. ,In her letter to the sports minister, she said Khan let her go because she physically resisted and tried to run.,""Then he forcefully took me back to the dinner. He told me to wash my face before I came down because I had been crying."",Sadia said she was highly distressed. When she returned to the dinner she barely ate and left for her brother's house immediately after. ,She wrote to the Punjab Sports Minister, Jahangir Khanzada, and the PHF the day after the incident, detailing what happened and demanding that action be taken against Khan. A copy of that letter, dated October 9, is available with ,, with instructions from Khanzada for an inquiry into the matter to be completed within 10 days. ,After that deadline lapsed without any action being taken, Sadia felt she should approach the media to present her case. She recorded a video statement to ask for help, which was circulated widely over the weekend.,Khan, who is currently in Brunei, has refuted the allegations against him.,“I’m not guilty at all and am ready to face any inquiry,” Khan had said at a press conference before leaving for Brunei. ,“If I was guilty, I would’ve escaped from the camp,” he said. ""She made these accusations out of frustration at being dropped from the team."" ,That narrative was seconded by Tanzeela Aamer, also present at the press conference, who said the former goalkeeper had accused the team coach of assault ""because she was dropped from the team"" selected to travel to Brunei.,Sadia also told , said that two days before she was assaulted, she had approached Khan to ask him why she had not been selected for the team.,In response to her questions, Sadia claimed, Khan had given her his number and asked her to ""call him at night"". ,She had mentioned the exchange in her complaint to PHF. ,“I thought, ‘you are in front of me, why should I call you’, but I did not say anything,"" Sadia recalled while speaking to ,. ,""I just felt it was not my destiny to be selected so I let it go."" Sadia said, adding that she never ended up making the phone call.,The PHF's women's wing secretary has said there will be no inquiry into the allegations made by Sadia, insisting ""they are baseless."" ,Speaking to ,, Tanzeela maintained that ""there is absolutely no need for any inquiry into the matter."",""Why will we take action if someone is making false allegations?"" Tanzeela said, denying that Sadia's version of the events of Oct 8 ever took place. ,""That girl [Sadia] does not know anything. Do you think if something like this happened to one of our girls, we would just let it go?"",""I was there, nothing happened,"" Tanzeela repeated, before abruptly hanging up.,""A committee should be formed comprising people from outside the PHF. I will argue my case in front of them,"" Sadia insisted while speaking to ,. ,Sadia said she wanted justice not only for herself, but also for Iqra Javed — her roommate — who had later corroborated Sadia's version of the alleged assault. ,Iqra paid dearly for speaking in Sadia's support.  ,After she went on record to say that other female players who had refuted Sadia's allegations were not telling the truth, she was dropped from the national team — which is currently touring Brunei for the Women's Asia Challenge — on ""disciplinary grounds"". ,Nageen Babar, who was originally travelling with the team as an umpire, was selected in Iqra’s place. ,Tanzeela ,""Iqra is a close friend of Sadia and they hail from the same place,"" she offered by way of an explanation. ""There can’t be any compromise on discipline,"" she said.,Speaking to , on Tuesday, Iqra recalled that Sadia was ""shivering and crying"" when she came into the hostel room on Oct 8.,""I asked her what the matter was when I saw the state she was in. But immediately after, Khan entered the room and told me to back off,"" Iqra said. She added that Khan had asked her to leave the room but she refused to do so.,""I am telling you what I saw in the room,"" Iqra told ,. ""I saw him grab her ,, her arm and then raise his hand at her."" ,""He then told her to wash her face before she came downstairs. I went downstairs with her to the dinner. Tanzeela Madam was there and she asked what was wrong, why we weren't eating,"" she recalled.,Iqra said that she does not know what had happened before Sadia and Khan came into the room except for what the former told her once the dinner was over. ,She said Sadia told her that Khan had asked her to step out of the dining hall and asked her what she was doing there when she had not been selected for the team travelling to Brunei. Sadia had replied that the team manager had asked her and some other girls to stay behind to collect their money, Jawed said. ,Jawed alleged that another player from the team had also witnessed what happened outside the dining hall between Khan and Sadia. She further corroborated Sadia's claim that Tanzeela, too, had witnessed the two arguing outside the hall.,""We do not know why she is refuting the allegations,"" Jawed wondered, recalling that Tanzeela had not witnessed what happened in the room as she was at the dinner. ,Jawed also knew about the 'call me' incident. She said that when Sadia first told her that Khan had given her his number, they had laughed it off together. ""We thought: 'What is he doing, he is the coach'."" ,""We did not know what he was thinking [...] that he would do this,"" she said.,""Sadia was specifically targetted,"" she said.,""They [the PHF] are using the players to protect themselves,"" Jawed alleged when asked about other players on the team refuting Sadia's allegations.,""I have been on the team for years and they dropped me [for standing up for Sadia]. How will any girl then speak up?"" ,""They know that the players come from small towns. This is their plan to protect themselves,"" she reflected. ,When asked how she felt after being dropped from the squad, Jawed said that she was proud for having done the right thing.,""These are grave allegations. Sadia is the sole earner of her family, why would she make these accusations falsely, knowing the harm they will bring to her?"" ,""My only fault is that I spoke the truth."""

382,2017-10-26,Suspect remanded in Perween Rahman murder case,"KARACHI: The administrative judge of antiterrorism courts remanded on Wednesday a suspect in police custody in a case pertaining to the murder of renowned social activist Perween Rahman. ,The police contended that Mohammad Amjad Hussain Khan was arrested on Oct 24 in Manghopir and they found a hand grenade and an unlicensed pistol in his custody.,The investigating officer produced the suspect before the court and submitted that the suspect was one of the absconders in Ms Rahman’s murder case and sought his custody for questioning as well as to arrest the other absconders.,The IO further submitted that the Supreme Court had directed the police on Oct 10 to arrest the absconders and now the matter is fixed before the apex court on Nov 15.,According to the remand papers, two suspects in the case, Qari Bilal and Mehfoozullah, have already been killed.,The administrative judge handed over the suspect to police on physical remand till Oct 27 and directed the IO to produce him again at next hearing along with a progress report.,The murder case is pending trial before an ATC against detained accused Ahmed Khan alias Ahmed Ali alias Pappu Kashmiri, Mohammad Imran Swati and Mohammad Raheem Swati, while Ayaz Swati, Amjad Afridi, Moosa and Shaldar Khan had been shown as absconders in the last charge-sheet.,The charge-sheet said Imran had disclosed that Rahim of banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan along with his brother-in-law Shaldar and others carried out the killing.,It contended that Imran also confessed that he was associated with Awami National Party in 2010 and was part of the meeting in which the murder was planned.,According to the prosecution, Ms Rahman, director of the Orangi Pilot Project, was gunned down on Manghopir Road in March 2013.,A case was registered under Sections 302 (premeditated murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code at the Pirabad police station. ,Later Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 was incorporated in the case on a directive of the Supreme Court that also had ordered a judicial inquiry into the case by the judge of a district and sessions court.,The judicial inquiry report, placed before the apex court in 2014, recommended that the murder be reinvestigated by an efficient, independent and honest police officer.

383,2017-10-26,Sport and harassment,"IT is a sad reflection on society when allegations of harassment are given short shrift by those whose responsibility it is to investigate such charges and take action. ,The recent case in which Syeda Sadia, the former goalkeeper of the women’s hockey team, alleged assault by her head coach is an example. ,According to Sadia, the coach tried to hit her, but was stopped by Tanzeela Aamer, secretary of the Pakistan Hockey Federation’s women’s wing. ,Following the player to her room, he apparently attempted to assault her again, threatening to ban her if she reported him. ,Her roommate, who tried to intervene, has been expelled from the team on ‘disciplinary grounds’. ,For such a serious charge, an official inquiry is essential. Ms Aamer should have supported a probe. ,Shockingly, she dismissed the need for one, calling the coach a ‘thorough gentleman’, even though Sadia claims she has fielded off other advances by him. He denies the allegation. ,There can be no two opinions: gendered assault and violence must not be tolerated under any circumstances; tragically, women suffer on account of these in most spheres of life, including sports.,Action is avoided in such cases of harassment because preserving an institution’s reputation outweighs harm done to the victim. ,Our culture of misogyny is such that women alleging sexual harassment or abuse are discredited, as is evident in the case of PTI lawmaker Ayesha Gulalai. ,It is almost a given: as a woman you will not only be humiliated for your experience but disbelieved; the resulting silence only nurtures predators. ,The suicide of cricketer Haleema Rafiq is another tragic example of not taking such allegations seriously. ,Disbelieved when she said the chairman of the Multan Cricket Club had demanded sexual favours, she eventually took her own life. ,Because such predatory behaviour is both overt and insidious, workplaces must define what constitutes harassment and initiate prompt action against the offenders. ,For women, staying silent should no longer be the safest option."

385,2017-10-26,Focus on death penalty,"			
,THE report that the federal government has at last been persuaded to review the laws under which capital punishment can be awarded for 27 offences , those who have been calling for such action for many years. ,The government decision follows official initiative at two levels. The Pakistan mission at Geneva drew the Foreign Office’s attention to the international community’s growing concern at the excessive use of the death penalty in this country. The criticism of Pakistan’s conduct in this regard became more and more strident when the country’s performance under the various human rights instruments was discussed by the relevant implementation bodies. ,On the basis of the submission made by the permanent mission at Geneva, the Foreign Office put up a summary to the prime minister in which it supported a reduction in the death penalty scope and suggested a longer period of life imprisonment for serious offences as an alternative.,It is difficult to believe that the mission at Geneva became aware of Pakistan’s non-compliance with UN instruments only in 2016 because such complaints against Pakistan have been piling up for many years. ,In 2013, Pakistan took the unusual and quite impolite decision to reject seven of the 167 recommendations made at the conclusion of the Universal Periodic Review and six of them had called for a review or repeal of death penalty provisions, especially of laws that provided for a mandatory death sentence.,Retention of capital punishment for 27 crimes amounts to jeopardising the citizens’ right to life.,The UN Human Rights Committee that made its final observations on Pakistan’s initial report under the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in July last asked the government to reinstate the moratorium on the death penalty and to seriously consider its abolition. ,It called for guarantees that death is awarded only for the most serious crimes, that it is never mandatory; that pardon and commutation are available in all cases, that it is never imposed by military courts, and that no child under 18 and no one suffering from psychological or intellectual disability is sentenced to death.,The government has also been asked to ensure that “Pakistani migrant workers subjected to death sentence overseas are provided with sufficient legal and consular services throughout their legal proceedings”.,It will not be politically correct to maintain that Pakistan is thinking of moving towards a humanitarian dispensation only and entirely due to foreign goading. The government will make its task of abridging the death penalty regime easier by acknowledging the campaign towards this end that Pakistan’s legal experts, young lawyers and civil society activists have been waging for many years.,The main reason for the state’s failure to adopt a rational attitude regarding the death penalty has been its morbid obsession with the idea of a deterrent and absolute punishment. Whenever the government has been asked about any plan to restore the moratorium or abolish the death penalty, the answer usually is that the restoration of the moratorium is not under consideration and the question of abolishing the death penalty simply does not arise. ,The fact is that the case for restricting the scope of the death penalty and putting a moratorium on any execution is quite strong. ,Quite a few of the laws under reference were made to suit the whim or fancy of self-appointed rulers without any mandate from the people or reference to them. In some other cases, poorly drafted manmade laws were presented as religious injunctions and thus protected against due scrutiny. ,The need for good laws is established by the judiciary and lawyers when they find the laws in force inadequate to deal with certain situations. The political parties, academics and civil society organisations can also derive justification for new laws from the experiences of the people. These requisites of sound lawmaking were not met when death was prescribed as punishment for many crimes.,We also saw that sometimes a law made ostensibly to protect women in fact made them more vulnerable. When rape and gang rape were made punishable by death, ie put in the category of murder, the criminals were given an option to eliminate the most important witnesses without enhancing their criminal liability.,A most powerful argument to trim the death penalty regime has been presented by the evidence that chances of miscarriage of justice in Pakistan have greatly increased. The three-member Supreme Court bench that has been hearing murder appeals has acquitted since Jan 1 this year at least 26 men whose death sentence had been confirmed by the high courts.,In most cases, the Supreme Court passed strictures on the prosecution and the trial courts because it found that the accused had been convicted on the basis of insufficient evidence, or the witnesses were unreliable or contradicted each other. In one case, the accused was a boy of 15 at the time of occurrence. ,This year we also had the case of Khizar Hayat, a man suffering from schizophrenia, whose execution was stopped at the last moment by a high court. ,With a system of justice so deeply flawed as revealed by these cases, retention of death penalty for 27 crimes amounts to jeopardising the citizens’ right to life.,The death penalty also adversely affects the psychology of the masses in several ways. It has a brutalising effect on society and strengthens the tendency towards violence and revenge.,The government must also accept the blame for failure to remove the impression that the death sentence for all the 27 crimes under discussion enjoys Islamic sanction whereas all religious authorities concede that Islam provides for death penalty only for two offences, murder and fasad fil arz. We may put aside these two crimes and start removing death as the punishment for the other 25 crimes. ,The government will do well to abridge the death penalty regime and bring it into harmony with progressive concepts of reformative justice in society’s best interest."
386,2017-10-27,Kim brother’s murder: video shows four N. Korean suspects,"SHAH ALAM: Prosecu­tors showed a Malaysian court airport security videos on Thursday that detail the movements of four North Korean suspects who allegedly planned and helped two women now facing possible death sentences kill Kim Jong Un’s estranged half brother.,Police chief investigating officer Wan Azirul Nizam Che Wan Aziz told the court that one of the suspects, known only as “Hanamori,” was believed to be the mastermind of Kim Jong Nam’s death. He said security footage from the Kuala Lumpur airport showed the four men before and after the Feb 13 attack.,Vietnamese suspect Doan Thi Huong and Indonesian defendant Siti Aisyah are the only two people in custody. They pleaded not guilty to murder charges when their trial began Oct 2.,Wan Azirul testified earlier that the four male suspects at large were known only by pseudonyms. Prosecutors have said outside court that the four are believe to be North Koreans.,“My investigation howed that Hanamori played the role as the mastermind of this incident,” he said. Hanamori was also known as “Grandpa” or “Uncle.” Wan Azirul said Hanamori arrived at the airport in the same vehicle with two others known as “Mr Chang” and “Mr Y” about 90 minutes before the attack. Security videos then showed Hanamori meeting separately with each of the men as well as a third person known only as “James” at an airport cafe before the attack on Kim.,Chang later met up with Aisyah at the same cafe, while Mr Y was seen walking around the airport with Huong near the area where Kim was attacked. The two men wore baseball caps and had backpacks. Mr Y was seen holding a water bottle, while Chang was also carrying a white plastic bag.,After the two women rubbed Kim’s face with a liquid later identified as VX nerve agent, video footage showed that Chang and Mr Y had changed their shirts and ditched their caps and backpacks. Wan Azirul said Chang had also shaved off his goatee. He said the two men then left the budget terminal in the same vehicle with Hanamori heading to the main airport terminal.,Meanwhile, James was seen heading to the Sama-Sama airport hotel after the attack. The police official said security videos showed James entering the hotel room before checking out and he later was seen at the departure hall of the main airport terminal together with the other three men.,Wan Azirul previously testified Mr Y and Chang were believed to have put liquid on the women’s hands before they smeared it on Kim’s face, and that James was the recruiter of Aisyah. Defence attorneys have said the women believed they were participating in a prank for a TV show but prosecutors have said the women knew they were handling poison.,The trial was cut short after the judge said he wanted to review the videos and will resume on Nov 6.,Aisyah’s lawyer, Gooi Soon Seng, told reporters before the trial that she was recruited in early January by a North Korean man known to her only as James to star in what he said were video prank shows. The lawyer said James and Aisyah went to malls, hotels and airports, where she would rub oil or pepper sauce on strangers’ faces. James recorded the encounters on his phone and paid Aisyah between $100 and $200 for each prank.,James later introduced Aisyah to a man he allegedly called Chang, who introduced himself as a producer of Chinese video prank shows, Gooi said. On the day of Kim’s death, Chang had pointed Kim out to Aisyah as the next target and put the substance in her hand, Gooi said."

398,2017-10-30,Reasons behind the increase in missing persons in Sindh,"			
,G M Syed’s birthday was coming up but he was under pressure from the government to call off public celebrations. Pakistan was under General Ziaul Haq’s military dictatorship. No political activity could be allowed — not even a celebratory event. Syed called a meeting of his senior comrades in his Sindhi nationalist movement at his native town of Sann to seek their views. Everyone favoured the cancellation. Everyone except Mohammad Rahimoon. He stood up and made a passionate argument in favour of holding the event. “I know a G M Syed who has always stood up to authority. I do not know a G M Syed who is willing to make a compromise,” he said. Syed had to let the celebrations proceed. ,That was 32 years ago.  ,On February 25, 2017, Rahimoon appeared before the media in Golarchi town of Badin district to announce that he had quit politics. This was also his first appearance in public after he had gone missing on November 22, 2016. He sounded bitter, according to a report in daily ,. The practitioners of Sindhi nationalism, he said, “did nothing when I was taken away”. ,Rahimoon has maintained public silence since then. He does not want to identify who kidnapped him or any details about where they took him and why. “I was treated well,” is the only thing he says of his time in disappearance. “They, indeed, are good people,” he says of those who had kept him in detention during that time.   ,His reluctance to give any other details has generated all kinds of stories. One legend goes that he was briefed about the activities of different Sindhi nationalist groups — that they have good relations with intelligence agencies, that they are not sincere to Sindhi nationalism, that they are opportunists. Another anecdote suggests he was shown a video about the lavish lifestyle and playful activities of Shafi Burfat, head of the outlawed Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), who lives in Germany. This video is also said to have images showing the pain and misery of the families of those Sindhi nationalist activists who have either disappeared or have died. ,These stories remain unconfirmed but their variants are pervasive in different parts of Sindh. Whenever a Sindhi nationalist activist announces his departure from politics, similar rumours and speculations circulate around his decision. And there have been many such announcements in recent months. In April this year, 22 activists in Ghotki district dissociated themselves from Sindhi nationalist politics; about five months later, 35 others did the same in Badin district; in September, three people in Tharparkar district’s headquarters, Mithi, renounced their links to Sindhi nationalist ideology. ,Most of them have called it quits from politics altogether. Others have joined non-nationalist parties — Nasrullah Kaladi being one of them.,He was heading the Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz-Bashir Qureshi Group (JSQMQ) in Ghotki district when he addressed a press conference in May 2017 and said he was moving away from the politics of Sindhi nationalism. About 50 other office holders and members of the JSQMQ made the same announcement along with him. Kaladi later joined the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). One rumoured reason for his change of parties is that he had been receiving threatening phone calls that alluded to his political activities. He does not confirm or deny this. ,Whether his move will protect him from more threats is not known yet. ,In at least one case, that of Nangar Channa, disavowal did not prevent disappearance. A writer from Larkana, Channa made a public declaration earlier this year that he was no longer associated with any Sindhi nationalist group. He still went missing on September 5, 2017. One of his friends links his disappearance with reports that he had renewed telephonic contact with his former political comrades. The truth is near impossible to find. ,Punhal Sario has been leading a campaign for the recovery of people going missing in Sindh. In May 2017, he was instrumental in setting up the Voice for Missing Persons of Sindh (VMP-Sindh), a group that includes human rights activists and the families of those who have disappeared. ,As the founding convener of the group, Sario led a long march from Hyderabad to Karachi in July this year. He was to hold a seminar in Hyderabad on August 4 but he went missing a day earlier. He was travelling in a car in Hyderabad with his friend Dr Haresh Kumar when, at about 11:00 pm, men in police commando uniforms took him away. He came back home on October 18. ,After his disappearance, Sorath Lohar has assumed his responsibilities at VMP-Sindh. Her father, Hidayatullah Lohar, has been missing since April this year. A primary school headmaster and an ironsmith in his spare time, he was a supporter of Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz-Arisar Group. “We do not know if he is still alive,” she says. ,			
,Sorath, who has a postgraduate degree in computer science and is studying law at Sindh Law College, Hyderabad, continues to organise protests for the recovery of missing persons even though she knows the risks involved. “Sometimes shopkeepers refuse to make banners for our protests at the eleventh hour. My younger brother gets threatening phone calls and has been warned that he would be abducted like our father if we continue participating in demonstrations,” she says. “Strangers often follow me. They make it obvious to me that they have pistols under their clothes.”  ,While Sorath’s association with the disappeared is obvious, others have faced problems even for raising a voice for them.  ,Qadir Bakhsh Zaor and Shams Meerani, both associated with a lesser known group, Jeay Sindh Liberal Front (JSLF), had placed an order at a shop in Thatta city for a banner that they would take to a protest for Sario’s recovery and release. On September 10, 2017, they were standing at that shop when a man approached Zaor and told him to follow him to a jeep parked nearby. He was told to get into the vehicle. Meerani joined him soon. ,“They handcuffed and blindfolded us and kept driving around for an hour and a half. They were abusing and hitting us, all the while demanding we reveal our links with Punhal Sario,” says Zaor.  ,When the two were taken off the jeep, they were beaten badly and ushered, one by one, into an air-conditioned room where some officers asked them various questions — where do you get money from; are you in touch with Shafi Burfat; have you ever been to India. After the interrogation, they were shifted to separate cells. Some officers came to Zaor’s cell later and told him that the JSMM had released Facebook posts about his disappearance. “I said I had nothing to do with the JSMM,” he says. ,A few hours afterwards, Meerani and him were taken to the historic graveyard of Makli and were released, but not before warning them that they needed to quit their group or else they would be picked up again. ,The disappearances of people linked to Sindhi nationalism, both directly as activists and indirectly as defenders of the rights of those activists, have increased significantly in 2017. Data collected by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) states that 110 nationalist activists as well as human rights defenders in Sindh disappeared between the months of January and August this year. In 2016, the number of such disappearances was six — though all of them still remain untraced.  ,Sindh Human Rights Defenders (SHRD), a volunteer organisation campaigning for the recovery of the disappeared, puts the number of people having gone missing in the province this year at 123 — only nine of them have come back home. Though such incidents have been taking place for years, their frequency has increased dramatically in the last few months, according to Ali Palh, a lawyer associated with the SHRD. “As many as 170 cases of enforced disappearances of Sindhi nationalists, students and human rights activists have been [recorded] … during the last five years. More than two-thirds of them have disappeared in 2017 alone,” he says. ,These numbers are mostly based on cases either reported to the police or by the media. In many other instances, people went missing for a short while –sometimes even less than a day – and came back home before the police or the media were informed about their disappearance. Some of them claim being kept in detention by intelligence agencies and tortured. While in captivity they were often accused of trying to give the military a bad name. They were also told that their leaders were getting money from India and that the children of those leaders were either studying abroad or at renowned institutions within Pakistan even as the children of ordinary activists lived miserable lives. ,According to G M Bhagat, an Umerkot-based writer and researcher approaching 70, a major reason behind the latest increase in enforced disappearances is the multibillion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). “The intelligence agencies treat [the critics of CPEC] as their enemies,” he says.  “Those who even whisper against CPEC are either kidnapped or killed.” Bhagat himself has been picked up four times by the intelligence agencies between the 1990s and 2006. When he was last taken away, he spent a whole year in their custody.,			
,The other known reason why so many Sindhi nationalists have gone missing is their alleged or actual involvement in anti-state activities such as burning of Pakistan’s flag, an allegation that is said to be behind the September 25, 2014 disappearance of a JSQM activist, Waheed Lashari, from Larkana. He was later found dead in Gulshan-e-Maymar, Karachi, on November 27 that year. ,These incidents may have some connection with the Pakistan Army too. An affidavit signed recently by a large group of Sindhi nationalists renouncing their political ideology ends on “Pakistan Zindabad, Pak Fauj [army] Zindabad”. It reads like an oath of allegiance: “We vow to be faithful to Pakistan. It is our country and we … will more than eagerly take part in its progress.”,Real or suspected links with the JSMM – a government-declared terrorist organisation that wants Sindh to become an independent state and that has accepted responsibility for a number of terror attacks in the province in recent years – ranks at the top of the list of reasons for the missing persons phenomenon. Many of the disappeared are known to have been warned during captivity: end links with the JSMM or else be prepared to face the music.,Zakir Bozdar paid the ultimate price for ignoring this warning. Associated with the JSMM, he first disappeared in May 2012 but came back home five months later. In December 2016, he disappeared again. Five days later, his body was found in his native Ghotki district. He was 30 at the time. “He had been told by his captors to quit the JSMM but he did not,” says one of 
his relatives. ,Some veterans of Jeay Sindh movement believe these capture and kill tactics may be unnecessary. In their estimation, disillusionment with the politics of an independent Sindh, or Sindhudesh, is pervasive and the struggle for it has already lost its ideological and political vigour. Most Sindhi nationalist leaders and activists have become opportunists, says Juman Darbadar, a Sindhi language poet from Umerkot who is known for his eulogies and elegies of Sindh. ,He joined the Jeay Sindh movement in 1978 as a young man and became quite close to its founder G M Syed. He soon wrote a poem that is regarded as Sindi nationalism’s anthem: “, (We will be born again and again until, my sweetheart, we meet in our own land of Mehran)”. Sung by many popular Sindhi singers and employed as a rallying cry for various Sindhi nationalist groups, the first couplet of this poem is inscribed at the entrance to Syed’s mausoleum in Sann. ,“Even those who are quitting Sindhi nationalist groups and joining other parties are doing so for personal and financial reasons more than anything else,” Darbadar remarks."

Before she decided to come to Pakistan she was told about Islam and the Pakistani culture. Ms Elizabeth reached Islamabad on April 14, 2016, leaving her parents behind, he added. ,Mr Khan said she felt depressed on seeing people gazing at her when he took her to Faisal Masjid for Nikah. ,“We got married three days after she arrived in Islamabad.

She was asking him to accompany her to the United States. ,“How can I leave my parents and family and go with her. Though I can visit her in the US after getting a visa, I can’t leave my parents who also love her and wanted her to live with them.” ,Mr Khan said he was in contact with her parents as they were very nice people and never opposed her decision to marry a Pakistani man after embracing Islam. “She used to ask me why people dislike the Americans,” he added."

More than a year on, however, lawyers and activists say honour killings are still occurring at an alarming pace. ,At least 280 such murders were recorded by the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan from October 2016 to June of this year ─ a figure believed to be underestimated and incomplete. ,""There has been no change,"" Benazir Jatoi, a lawyer who works for the independent Aurat Foundation, a women's rights watchdog, told ,. ,""In fact, the Peshawar High Court twice acquitted a man of honour crimes after this law was passed,"" she added. ,The legislation mandates life imprisonment for honour killings, but whether a murder can be defined as a crime of honour is left to the judge's discretion. ,That means the culprits can simply claim another motive and still be pardoned, said Dr Farzana Bari, a widely respected activist and head of the Gender Studies Department at Islamabad's Quaid-i-Azam University. ,They can do so under Pakistan's , (blood money) and , (retribution) law, which allows them to seek forgiveness from a victim's relatives ─ a particularly convenient means of escape in 'honour' cases. ,Bari called for a study on the murders of women over the past year to ascertain the scale of the problem. ,The convoluted courts system also often sees police encouraging parties to enter blood money compromises, circumventing the beleaguered judicial system altogether. ,""Forgiveness and compromise negates justice,"" Jatoi said. ,Asma Jahangir, one of Pakistan's most acclaimed human rights lawyers, agreed, telling ,: ""The law will be implemented once the courts function."" ,The roots of 'honour' killings lie in tribal social norms which remain prevalent across South Asia and dictate the behaviour of women in particular. ,Women have been shot, stabbed, stoned, set alight and strangled for bringing ""shame"" on their families for everything from refusing marriage proposals to wedding the ""wrong"" man and helping friends elope. ,Men can be victims too, but the violence is overwhelmingly aimed at women. ,The double standard is glaring. ,Generally Pakistanis will accept a man who has committed rape, a senior police official who has overseen honour killing investigations told ,. ,But ""if a woman is even suspected of an affair, it is considered a shame for the family and not forgiven,"" the official, who asked to remain anonymous as he was not authorised to speak to media, told ,. ,""People even sympathise [with] and praise the men who murder their women for so-called honour,"" he said. ,Even when the state does take steps to implement the law ─ as with the murder of Qandeel Baloch ─ the wheels of justice often get stuck in the mud. ,Baloch achieved notoriety in Pakistan with her social media antics.,Her brother Waseem told reporters that ""of course"" he had strangled his sister, finding her behaviour ""intolerable"". ,Baloch's heartbroken parents vowed they would give Waseem no absolution. ,But well over a year later, the trial is still grinding its way through the courts. ,This length of time is not unheard of for murder cases.,For Jatoi, the issue goes far beyond the courts ─ from the elites, where the political leadership fails to understand the issue, to the rural masses, where illiteracy and poverty help perpetuate it. ,Rights activists have called for change for years, and Pakistan's young, urbanised population often take to social media for campaigns such as last year's #NoMoreKillingGirls. ,But Jatoi said Pakistan as a society has been unable to move past the meaning of ""honour"". ,""Only when we widely condemn the act will we stop seeing proud murderers... telling of how they killed a woman because she breached an outdated, arbitrary, and patriarchal 'honour' code of which no one knows the rules."""

414,2017-11-01,Man in the middle,"			
,ON Tuesday, Oct 24, 2017, a British-Pakistani woman appeared at the Old Bailey Court in London. Twenty-seven-year-old Sabah Khan was accused of murdering her sister Saima Khan. But there would be no trial in the case. When it was her turn to plead, Sabah Khan chose to enter a guilty plea. When she reappeared in the same courtroom two days later, the judge sentenced her to life in prison, with a minimum of 22 years to be served. ,The sordid saga of jealousy, manipulation and exploitation that took one Khan sister’s life and led to the imprisonment of the other began not last May, when Saima Khan was murdered, but four years ago, when Saima’s husband, 37-year-old Hafeez Rehman, began an affair with Sabah, his unmarried sister-in-law. Rehman kept the affair secret, routinely breaking it off and then starting it again. ,A father of four children, one of whom was born a little over a year before the murder, Rehman used WhatsApp to exchange messages with Sabah even while he lived with her sister and the girl’s parents. Unlike the sisters, who were of Pakistani origin but largely grew up in the UK, Rehman had migrated from Pakistan. His marriage to Saima allowed him to obtain a British passport. ,The murder of a woman in Britain is illustrative of the complex ills that beset the Pakistani community.,In the years that the affair continued, Sabah became increasingly obsessed with Rehman. At one point in time, she became pregnant with his child. Because the affair was secret (or at least everyone involved pretended not to know about it), she was forced to have an abortion. It was alleged that at one point Rehman inquired whether he could be married to both sisters at the same time. When he learned that this was forbidden in Islam, he chose to continue with the affair. ,Even though he claimed he tried to end the relationship, there seems to be evidence to the contrary. Long before then, tensions between the sisters had risen to the point that Sabah was living separately from the rest of the family for some time. In March 2016, the increasingly desperate Sabah, seeing little hope for a change, even contacted a ‘practitioner’ of the ‘black arts’ in Pakistan. Speaking in the third person on the messages exchanged, she asked for assistance in getting rid of her sister. It is alleged that she paid the person £5,000 to make this happen. ,But Saima did not die and everything came to a head on the night of May 26, 2016, at around 11:00 pm. Saima, who worked as a healthcare aide for an elderly lady, was at work. The four children, the eldest of whom was a daughter about seven years old, slept upstairs. Sabah was home taking care of them. Her parents and Rehman had gone out. At this time, Sabah texted her sister, asking her to come home. Her youngest daughter, only a year or so old at the time, was crying for her, she said. Not long after, Saima returned home, entirely unaware of any danger at all. CCTV footage released to the media shows that Sabah had already purchased a sharp knife from a supermarket. ,As soon as Saima’s key turned in the lock and she entered the hallway, Sabah attacked her. Post-mortem reports show that Sabah stabbed her sister 68 times. One of the wounds was so deep that it nearly decapitated the victim. At least one of the children woke up because of the commotion and asked her aunt if she was killing her mother. Sabah broke a window and threw the black and bloody clothes she had worn to carry out the attack into plastic bags and out of the window. She hid the murder weapon in a bedroom. Then she called emergency services and alleged that a robbery had taken place in the house and her sister had been murdered. When the ambulance arrived, Saima was, of course, already dead. ,The sad and gruesome story of the murder of an innocent woman by her sister is in a sense an illustration of the many complex ills plaguing the British-Pakistani community in towns like Luton. Hailing largely from rural areas of Punjab, many in these communities still follow the stunted dictates of a culture frozen on the date of their migration. The desirability of a British passport in Pakistan and the desire to marry daughters within a circle of close relatives has led to increasing problems.,Apart from the current instance, marriages built on the need of one party to migrate are rife with the potential for exploitation. Furthermore, marriage between cousins, as is very common in these communities, is often solemnised under the pressure of parents and family. The statistics are telling: out of more than 1,400 cases of forced marriage reported in the UK in 2016, almost half involved the Pakistani community. In addition to this scourge, Islamophobia among many segments of British society appears to be on the rise. This together with the constant scrutiny by security services creates a high-pressure environment that is highly combustible.,In this case it was Sabah Khan who killed her sister and Sabah Khan who will spend the rest of her life in jail. And while the woman who committed the crime must rightly be punished for it, some anger and attention should also be directed at the man at the heart of it, a man who seems to have evaded any kind of punishment. If Sabah Khan wielded the knife and stabbed her sister, it was Rehman who drove her to it. In love triangles it is often the women who blame each other. While there are no lessons that can be drawn from such a heartbreaking tragedy, perhaps we can pause and wonder why men are hardly ever the ones to blame. "

435,2017-11-07,Footprints: Home at last,"GUJRANWALA: Clad in blue jeans and a light blue T-shirt, Hina sits quietly between her mother, Fatima, and maternal aunt Mumtaz.,Now 11, Hina was born at an Amritsar jail in August 2006, soon after her mother, aunt and maternal grandmother, Rashida, were arrested at the Attari railway station — on their way to Delhi to attend a family wedding — on charges of possessing 400 grams of drugs. While Rashida died of a heart attack in jail in 2008, Hina set foot on Pakistan soil for the first time on Nov 2 with her mother and the aunt after they were ,. ,“We have slept only for two hours since we got here. We’re elated to see so many people coming to meet us. It seems all of Gujranwala has come over to us,” says Mumtaz, Fatima’s younger sister. ,About their May 7, 2006 ordeal, Mumtaz says they were arrested purely on suspicion because the real culprit — a Lahore-based fellow passenger aboard the Samjhota Express — had left his luggage with them while he went to take care of immigration. All the drugs were found in his luggage, which he admitted to after arrest — yet it were the women who were jailed. ,“We were worried how we’ll be treated,” recalls Fatima. “We were so depressed that we ate very little for eight days. On the ninth day, the jail superintendent assured us we were his responsibility and that he’d take care of us.”,Four months later, Hina was born. “I was admitted to a hospital a month earlier and discharged 15 days after Hina was born. The woman constables staying with me at the hospital took great care of me there,” Fatima says, adding that she had no trouble bringing up Hina and is thankful to the jail staff for their courtesy, help and support. ,The inmates’ first contact with their family was a few weeks before Hina’s birth when officials of the Pakistan High Commission visited them for counselling. The women were assigned a lawyer, D. P. Sharma, who assured them that he would get them out. When the case was heard in the sessions court, the women were convicted. Sharma then appealed in the high court, but kept charging the family back home without the women’s knowledge. ,“He would tell us he was helping us for God’s sake, but he’d made around Rs500,000 from our family,” muses Fatima. “Then we found out he wasn’t sincere and we sought another lawyer. Advocate Navjot Kaur Chhaba fought our case earnestly and ensured bail. She even contacted an NGO to arrange the Rs400,000 fine, but didn’t charge a penny herself.”,Hina was sent to school with other inmates’ children. She studied just outside the jail premises until Grade 5. She’s too shy to recall how she felt upon stepping into Pakistan, but her father, Saifur Rehman, chips in: “When she came home she wouldn’t talk for some time. She was scared.” ,“I feel great. I’m really happy to have come to Pakistan,” is what she barely says now. “I went shopping with my father yesterday.” Prodded by other family members, Hina talks almost in a whisper about having seen her family’s pictures when they exchanged letters in jail. “In school, I learned Hindi, Punjabi, gidda and boli. I also made five friends there whom I really miss.” ,The day of return was no less than a celebration. Fellow inmates congratulated them, jail staff wished them well, locals showered them with gifts, and Hina’s school principal and teachers saw her off at the border. All three were given new clothes. Fatima tells me there was an ex-inmate who developed a special bond with Hina; she would call the child her granddaughter. ,The feeling of stepping back into their own country was overwhelming, the women say. There was happiness, there were tears, there was azaan, and of course, some food. Fatima says that the Punjab Rangers cooked food for them when they crossed over the border, and welcomed them warmly. But Hina wouldn’t eat: “I insisted on meeting my father, brothers and sisters before eating anything,” she says. ,Saifur Rehman recalls the distressing 11 years they had to go through. “I had to marry off my two daughters in their mother’s absence. Now, thank God, my family is complete. But I have hardly spent any time with Hina.” ,The former inmates say they were treated warmly while they were in jail. Yet the one person they say they will be eternally grateful to is their lawyer, Advocate Navjot Chhaba.,“We will never forget what Chhaba ma’am did for us. For a whole year she struggled tirelessly for our release. She didn’t help us because we were Pakistani, but on humanitarian grounds. She came to see us off at the border,” says Mumtaz. ,Amid these celebratory moments, there is some bitterness. Hina’s maternal uncle, Shafiq, believes that the Pakistani side did nothing to secure his family’s release. “No one from the government asked us what had happened. We contacted many MNAs, MPAs, even sent a message to the chief minister when he visited before the 2013 elections,” he complains. “But there was no help forthcoming.” "
436,2017-11-08,KP police offer army to withdraw most troops from Malakand,"PESHAWAR: Inspector General of Police, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Salahuddin Khan Mehsud has said the police department has offered the Pakistan Army to withdraw around two-thirds of its troops from Malakand division in the wake of the expansion of the force’s role in the previously troubled region.,“The police department can confidently meet security responsibilities in Malakand division in case of the army’s withdrawal (from the division), he told Dawn.,Mr Mehsud said the police were in a position to maintain law and order in urban centres of the province as the Pakistan Army’s troops would remain on guard in peripheries.,IGP claims his force can meet security responsibilities well in once restive division,“We are gradually expanding our role,” he said.,The police chief said if told, his force would confidently go into Fata as it was already working very closely with the Pakistan Army in KP.,He said the process to set up public safety bodies in the province under the KP Police Act, 2017, was in its final stages and that those bodies would become functional soon.,Mr Mehsud said the rules for the Provincial Public Safety and Police Complaints Commission and regional police complaint authorities to set up under the act had been forwarded to the Peshawar High Court for approval.,He said the police department would begin a campaign to create public awareness of those safety bodies, especially their role to keep watch on the police, after their formation.,“I will personally go to the people to let them know about the safety nets they [people] have against the police’s excesses,” he said, adding that the people needed to be taught about that.,The police chief said the new legislation had provided multiple bodies, which had powers to take action on the people’s complaints, while an inquiry under those bodies would be considered to be under the service rules.,He said after the establishment of public safety bodies, the police would not be able to hide their mistakes as those independent bodies had been tasked with supervising their activities.,“Once this system starts working, the number of complaints against the police will drop significantly,” he said.,Mr Mehsud said the police had also set up an internal accountability branch, which had so far punished 7,811 cops.,“A total of 987 police officials, including 13 officers, have been given the major punishment of discharge from service,” he said, adding that the police have also established a human rights vigilance cell headed by an additional inspector general level officer to monitor violation of human rights.,The police official denied that most of his force’s officials sacked on people’s complaints got their jobs back within months, insisting that all such officials were reinstated by the service tribunal.,He also said there were instances of the police department even approaching the apex court against the service tribunal’s decision.,Mr Mehsud also said the officials from junior ranks to DSP’s mostly dealt with the people and therefore, more junior officials were punished compared to senior ranks.,“The higher number of complaints against junior officials is proportional to their higher numbers vis-à-vis officers,” he said.,About the complaints of the police’s highhandedness during search and strike operations, Mr Mehsud said such operations were meant to deny bases to terrorists and therefore, they could not afford laxity in that respect.,“It is very difficult to balance public inconvenience and security measures against terrorism,” he said.,The police chief also rejected the impression that conviction in terrorism and other cases was very low, claiming the rate of conviction has instead gone up.,He said the police had arrested more than 1,200 terrorists and militants, while around 90 percent of them were still behind bars.,Mr Mehsud said historically, the conviction rate in cases of terrorism had gone up to 50 percent in KP as suggested by independent reports.,He said the police department was conducting workshops to improve investigations by its personnel, while a media campaign would be launched to increase the people’s awareness on the matters related to the police, especially on the registration of FIR.,The police chief also opposed the amendments to the KP Police Act saying such a move would do more harm than good.,He said the police were returning to their traditional role of ‘watch and ward’ while paying due attention to counterterrorism.,“We also want the people feel normal,” he said.,Mr Mehsud said there was no bases of Daesh terrorist group in KP and Fata and that the police had the capability to fight any terrorist network wanting to enter the province.,He said lawlessness in the neighbourhood definitely had its impact on KP and therefore, his department was alert to it and made plans accordingly."

450,2017-11-13,View from the courtroom: UN working group set to review country’s progress on human rights,"The United Nations Human Rights Council’s Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is set to consider on Monday (today) the National Report of Pakistan sharing progress made in the field of human rights from 2012 to 2017. This is the third UPR Report of Pakistan to be considered by the Working Group. The earlier two reports were reviewed in May 2008 and Oct 2012, respectively. ,While through this report the Government of Pakistan has tried to portray the overall human rights situation in the country, it has failed to address some of the recommendations of the previous review about which it had extended its support on some of the issues especially that of “Enforced and involuntary disappearances,” impunity to perpetrators of violence against human rights defenders and mediapersons, domestic violence, child marriages, rights of religious minorities, bonded labour, etc. ,The advance questions put forward by different member states of the Working Group also focuses on different issues specially the issue of “Enforced disappearances”, death penalty, customary practices, including honour killing, misuse of blasphemy law, right to free and compulsory primary education, prevention of torture, etc. ,In the previous UPR Report, there were several recommendations by the members related to “enforced disappearances”. Recommendation No 20 states: “Specifically criminalize enforced disappearances in the penal code and reinforce the capacities of the Pakistan Inquiry Commission on Enforced Disappearances in order that the commission can fully carry out its mission.” ,Recommendation No 111 provided: “Reinforce its efforts to fight impunity regarding cases of enforced disappearance by bringing all responsible persons to justice.” The recommendation No 114 provided: “Take effective measures against enforced disappearances by strengthening the Commission of Inquiry and expanding their mandate to all security agencies. Vest the National Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances (COIED) greater authority and resources to conduct investigation.” ,The Government of Pakistan had submitted its response to the recommendations made in the UPR Report 2012 in March 2013, and had spelled out its commitment to most of those recommendations, and also expressed its inability to support some of the recommendations. ,While the government had extended support to the recommendations related to “enforced disappearances” it had also stated that the government had been implementing another relevant recommendation which states: “Ensure investigation and prosecution of those responsible for abduction and enforced disappearances and encourage the Supreme Court to continue investigation on this problem.” ,While the superior courts and COIED continue to hear cases of “missing persons”, the government has yet to incorporate provisions in Pakistan Penal Code related to this phenomenon. There are provisions in the law related to wrongful confinement, but no specific provision has been incorporated to deal with “enforced disappearances.” Similarly, as far as prosecution of elements involved in such offences is concerned, it has still been a far cry. ,Over this issue, in its National Report the government has mostly mentioned the performance of COIED as the steps it has taken to implement the said recommendations. “In order to take effective measures to deal with the issue of enforced disappearances, in April 2010, the federal government set up the COIED. The Commission also has powers to order production of a person in respect of whom it is suspected by the Commission to be held in illegal detention of some Law Enforcement/Intelligence Agency,“ the report states. ,The report provides that the Commission has been able to dispose of 2,416 cases from March 2011 to November30, 2016, of which 1,798 persons have been traced as either returned home or confined in jails/Internment/Rehabilitation Centres on criminal/terrorism charges and the remaining 618 cases were closed either due to non-prosecution or after thorough investigation found these not being cases of enforced disappearances. ,Recommendation No 21 states: “Enact a provincial legislation on domestic violence as well as an increased number of support structures for women on the provincial level.” ,While the other three provinces have enacted law dealing with domestic violence, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has yet to enact the relevant law. For the last many years different bodies, including KP Provincial Commission on Status of Women, have been working on draft of a Bill, but so far it could not be tabled in the provincial assembly. ,Another recommendation relates to forced and child marriages, which states: “Take effective measures to prevent forced or early marriage, in particular with a view to ending rape, sexual exploitation and forced conversions of scheduled caste girls.” ,While the colonial-era Child Marriages Restraint Act, 1929, remained in vogue in the country, controversy continues to persists regarding several of its provisions especially about what should be minimum permissible age for a female child to marry. The existing law mentions the prohibitory age as 16 years for a female child and 18 years for a male child. ,About the rights of journalists, Recommendation No 118 provides: “Bring to justice perpetrators of attacks on journalists by effectively investigating all individuals and organizations accused of such abuses.” Similarly, Recommendation No 119 states: “Introduce strong legislation prohibiting attacks against journalists to effectively investigate such acts and prosecute the perpetrators. ,Despite the commitment made by the government, cases of violence against mediapersons continued during last couple of years. Recently, a journalist Ahmad Noorani was attacked by unidentified persons and was severely tortured. Similarly, three journalists named Shahnawaz Khan Tarkzai from Mohmand Agency, Islam Gul Afridi from Khyber Agency and a freelancer Junaid Ibrahim, were picked up separately by unidentified persons in October. The former two were set free after an overnight captivity, whereas the third one was set free after three days. ,The situation of human rights defenders also remained gloomy during last five years. One of the prominent cases was that of a female freelance journalist and human rights defender, Ms Zeenat Shehzadi, who was pursing case of an Indian national Hamid Nehal Ansari. She was kidnapped in Lahore in Aug 2015 and was set free by her captives after over two years of captivity in Oct 2017. So far no details are available as to who had kidnapped her and where she had been kept. ,Advocate Malik Jarar, an office-bearer of Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, was killed in Feb 2013. Lawyer and member of HRCP, Rashid Rehman was killed in May 2014 in Multan. He was receiving threats as he was defending an accused in a blasphemy case."

460,2017-11-15,"Pakistanis ‘not free’ online for sixth consecutive year, says report","KARACHI: For the sixth year in a row, Pakistan was termed “not free” by the Freedom House in its Freedom on the Net report released on Tuesday. ,The report for the year 2017, which was researched by the Digital Rights Founda­tion (DRF) and research analysts at the Freedom House, assesses internet freedom in 65 countries, accounting for 87 per cent of internet users worldwide. ,The report primarily focuses on developments that occurred between June 2016 and May 2017. ,In Pakistan, the report said that mobile internet services were shut down for more than a year in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) starting in June 2016. ,It went on to say that the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, enacted in August 2016, introduced stronger censorship and surveillance powers with inadequate oversight. ,Key findings of the report highlighted cases where a teenager was arrested for allegedly “liking” a blasphemous post on Facebook in September 2016, a court awarded the death penalty in a separate Facebook blasphemy case in June this year and five bloggers, known for criticising authorities and religious militancy, were abducted in January — one later said that a government institution had detained and tortured him. ,It also added that hackers stepped up attempts to target government critics and attacked a major media website. ,“Internet regulation by the government and prosecution with regard to online speech has seen a marked increase,” said Nighat Dad, the executive director of DRF. ,“The coverage period of this report includes the electronic crimes act which criminalises a lot of online speech. It has seen detentions on the basis of online speech. There have also been internet shutdowns in more remote parts of the country which means that marginalised populations have been denied access to the internet,” she said, adding that the only way to combat this would be to monitor the implementation of laws and ensure resources were allocated towards addressing issues like online violence against women and other vulnerable communities rather than targeting political speech. ,Discussing how the DRF collected data for the report, Ms Dar said they tracked developments in terms of legislation, case law, reported detentions, primary and secondary sources. ,“While researching we came across some shocking things such as how online users, especially minorities, were being persecuted and sentenced to death over social media posts,” she added. ,The report said that the country’s Internet Freedom Status for the year 2017 had in fact worsened from that in 2016 with the ranking of 18 out of 25 for Obstacles to Access for 2016, the bar sits at 19 for the year 2017; and Violations of User Rights which sat at 31 out of 40 for the year 2016; it’s now at 32. ,The overall ranking for Pakistan closes at 71 out of 100 (100 being the worst) for this year, two points down from last year’s ranking. ,The report seeks to address failings of the state in protecting the rights of citizens by compiling and analysing evidence that activists and citizens concerned can use to push for greater democracy online as well as offline."

474,2017-11-21,An unspoken ordeal: Rape and 'forgiveness' in Pakistan's madressahs,"Saima Khan* struggles through tears as she remembers the blood-soaked pants of her 9-year-old son, allegedly raped by a religious cleric. Each time she begins to speak, she stops, swallows hard, wipes her tears and begins again. ,The boy fidgets with his scarf and looks over at his mother. ,“Did he touch you?” He nods. “Did he hurt you when he touched you?” “Yes,” he whispers. ,“Did he rape you?” He buries his face in his scarf and nods yes. ,Sexual abuse is a pervasive and longstanding problem at madressahs in Pakistan, an , investigation has found. But in a culture where clerics are powerful, it is seldom discussed or even acknowledged in public. ,			
,It is even more seldom prosecuted, according to the investigation, based on police documents and dozens of interviews with victims, families, officials and aid groups. ,Police are often paid off not to pursue justice against clerics, victims' families say. And cases rarely make it past the courts, because the legal system allows the victim's family to “forgive” the offender and accept what is often referred to as , (blood money). ,A tally of cases reported in newspapers over the past 10 years of sexual abuse by clerics and other religious officials came to 359. ,			
,That represents “barely the tip of the iceberg,” says Munizae Bano, executive director of Sahil, an organisation that scours the newspapers for such cases.,In 2004, an official disclosed more than 500 complaints of sexual assaults against young boys in madressahs. He has since refused to talk.,Two officials familiar with the madressahs said sexual abuse there happens all the time. They asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution from militant groups. One compared the situation to the abuse of children by priests in the Catholic Church. ,“There are thousands of incidences of sexual abuse in the madressahs,” he says. “This thing is very common...I am not sure what it will take to expose the extent of it. It's very dangerous to even try.” ,Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Muhammad Yousaf dismisses the suggestion that sexual abuse is widespread, saying such talk is an attempt to malign the religion, seminaries and clerics. ,He acknowledges that it could occur occasionally “because there are criminals everywhere.” ,The Interior Ministry, which oversees madressahs, refused repeated written and telephone requests for an interview. ,More than 22,000 registered madressahs in Pakistan teach at least 2 million students, often among the country's poorest, who receive food and an education for free. ,Thousands more madressahs are unregistered and operate without scrutiny, like the one attended by Saima's son. ,Read: ,When offending clerics pay police off, they refuse to even register a case, according to the victims' families. ,The families involved are often poor and powerless. ,“We are being pressured to compromise,” says a man from Punjab. His younger brother says he was sexually assaulted at a madressah by a cleric who threatened to kill his family if he told. ,Multan Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Police Sultan Azam Temuri denies that pressure from clerics or powerful politicians prompts police to go easy in such cases. ,He says cases are investigated when allegations are made. Temuri says his department is trying to tackle child abuse in general with the introduction of gender and child protection services. ,Victims and their families can also choose to “forgive” an assailant because Pakistan's legal system is a mix of British Common Law and Shariah law. ,			
,A similar legal provision was changed last year to prevent forgiveness of ,, where victims are murdered because they are thought to have brought shame on their families. Honour killings now carry a mandatory sentence of life in prison, but clerics in sexual abuse cases can still be forgiven. ,Victims and their families often come under intense pressure to “forgive” the crime, or essentially settle for money. Many do, partly because they don't believe they have the power to do anything else. ,Sahil offers families legal aid to pursue such cases. Last year, Sahil found 56 cases of sexual assault involving religious clerics. Yet, none of the families accepted Sahil's offer of legal assistance. ,Read: ,The story of Saima's son, who says he was raped by his teacher in Kahror Pakka, Lodhran shows how difficult it is to get justice in cases of sexual abuse at madressahs.,At the courthouse in Kahror Pakka, the former cleric waited his turn to go before a judge. A half dozen members of the militant organisation Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) were there to support the teacher.,			
,They scowled and moved closer when an , reporter sat next to the teacher, who was shackled to a half dozen other prisoners. The whispers grew louder and more insistent. ,“It's too dangerous here,” said one person, looking over at the militants nearby. “Leave. Leave the courthouse, they can do anything here.” The teacher had already confessed, according to police, and the police report said he was found with the boy. Yet, he swore his innocence in court. ,“I am married, why would I do this?” he said. ,In the end, the mother, Saima, “forgave” the cleric and accepted approximately Rs30,000, according to police. The cleric was set free.,*"

478,2017-11-23,Mercy plea to the president,"			
,MR Mamnoon Hussain,
President, Islamic Republic of Pakistan,
I am taking the liberty of seeking Your Excellency’s intervention to secure an end to the plight of six individuals. One of them is a woman journalist and defender of human rights, another is a young teacher from across the border, and the other four are young students who were unfortunately born into Baloch families.,Zeenat Shahzadi, a young and poor journalist without any clout, had dreams of helping her fellow human beings. She was abducted from outside her house in Lahore on July 11, 2015, and her name was added to the ,. Since I am not sure that the press clippings presented for your perusal include reports of mundane affairs such as disappearances, I believe it is necessary to tell this young woman’s tale of woe in some detail.,When Zeenat Shahzadi learnt that an , for trying to help a Pakistani girl, she thought this was a case that could help her establish herself as a bold human rights defender and a skilful journalist. She persuaded Hamid Ansari’s mother to grant her authority/ permission to pursue the matter before the Peshawar High Court. She also met the Indian high commissioner at a public meeting, probably to seek his help in the case. ,All this was not considered an infringement of any law as no legal action was taken against her. Her disappearance was referred to the Commission of Inquiry into Enforced Disappearances then headed by retired Supreme Court justice Javed Iqbal.,The human rights community is concerned at Zeenat Shahzadi’s disappearance for the second time.,The commission held a number of meetings in Lahore and heard the reports of the police and a joint investigation team including representatives of the intelligence services but they could not trace Shahzadi. Her family was devastated. Driven to despair her younger brother chose to end his life.,Then one fine morning, a few weeks ago, Mr Javed Iqbal personally rang up the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and announced that ,. The community of human rights activists across the globe was so overjoyed that it chose not to discuss the version that Shahzadi had been recovered from the clutches of some non-state actors on the border in Balochistan.,Shahzadi’s return was confirmed by her mother but telephonic access to Shahzadi was not possible. Sometime later the mother said that they were in an Islamabad hospital. That was the last time the mother answered a call.,Excellency, the entire human rights community, in Pakistan and abroad, is concerned at Zeenat Shahzadi’s disappearance for the second time. It should be possible for you to oblige the persons who are keeping Shahzadi out of public view to bring her into the open. It may not be impossible for them to find their way to the nearest press club or to a court to get her statement recorded. The Supreme Court has been asking for the recording of victims’ statements after they have been recovered. ,The second person on my list is Hamid Ansari. He was working as an assistant professor at an Indian management institute. Through Facebook he became friendly with a girl belonging to Kohat and when she feared the denial of her rights, he decided to come to her rescue. He could not get a Pakistan visa but was able to fly to Afghanistan and enter Pakistan, though without valid papers. He was arrested from a hotel in Kohat on Nov 14, 2012. Thus, for five years he has been in the custody of the Pakistani authorities. , and not with illegal entry into Pakistan, he was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment by a military court.,There is no doubt that Hamid committed an offence but his motives, love or a desire to help a woman in distress, are strong mitigating circumstances. He has already suffered enough for his naiveté.,In a letter to the writer, Hamid’s mother has requested her appeal for mercy to be forwarded to the competent authority. Hence, this letter. Her prayer is that the period of Hamid’s detention (three years) before conviction may be counted as sentence served, that he may he be released on humanitarian grounds, and that he may be allowed to talk to his family on the phone.,, your government has shown clemency to foreign nationals who have committed far graver offences than Hamid Ansari. The country’s credit for listening to humanitarian calls will go up and the chances of relief for Pakistani citizens in Indian prisons might improve if you could remit the remaining period of Hamid’s prison term.,Finally, I solicit your intervention in the case of the alleged disappearance after arrest of four Baloch student activists — Sanaullah, Hassam, Naseer and Rafeeq. I know the official reply would be , (this keeps happening every day). But , (whatever happens every day has to be stopped someday). If these students have committed an offence, they may be tried in an open court. Their right to meet the family and their counsel and to a fair trial, with normal guarantees of respect for due process, cannot be compromised. Kindly tell the authorities concerned that highhandedness in dealing with the youth will only accelerate the Baloch people’s alienation from the state. The Baloch can be won over only by showing due respect to them and their rights.,It might be said that the law must take its course. But I have written to you precisely because the law has not been taking the course in these cases from which it must not deviate. ,I am sorry for not approaching Your Excellency through the prescribed channels, but I have reason to believe that the president of the Islamic Republic cannot ignore a call for mercy regardless of the route it takes.,Yours faithfully,
I. A. Rehman, a human rights activist"

480,2017-11-24,Death of minor girl in Karachi road accident sparks protests,"			
,Reckless driving on Karachi's busy M.A. Jinnah Road on Friday morning took the life of a minor girl, triggering anger among the people who set two buses on fire before the arrival of law enforcers who took 11 protesters into custody over rioting charges as the drivers of both vehicles managed to escape, officials said.,The five-year-old girl was on her way to school with her father on a motorbike when a passenger bus collided with the bike. The girl's father sustained injuries in the accident.,The police attributed the cause of the accident to rash driving.,According to Saddar Superintendent Police Tauqeer Mohammed Naeem, two public transport buses were racing against each other. When they reached near Mama Parsi School, the 4-K route bus tried to overake another bus on the wrong side of the street, hitting the motorbike and injuring Sakeena, 5, and her father, Huzaifa.,They were transported to nearby Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi where doctors pronounced the girl dead on arrival, additional police surgeon, Dr Qarar Ahmed Abbasi said. Huzaifa was admitted to the trauma centre for treatment.,The incident enraged people in the area as the drivers of the both buses escaped. A charged mob set both vehicles on fire, completely destroying them, a Fire Brigade official said.,The driver of the bus, identified as Muhammad Salim, was arrested Friday evening, SSP Javed Akbar Riaz announced. The official said the owner of the bus had also been detained.,According to a police statement, the Preedy station reported that the accident took place at about 7:30am. As a reaction, ""aggressive people"" set a coach on fire, blocked the road and damaged transport, the statement said. ,A Fire Brigade official said they received information about torching of the buses at about 8:58 am. ,They sent one fire tender but the mob allegedly manhandled the firemen and pelted stones at the fire tender, forcing them to turn back.,The fireman said that three police mobiles led by the area deputy superintendent police were present at the site but they did not intervene to prevent the mob from attacking the firemen.,Subsequently, firemen arrived at 9:17 am and got the fire under control under the supervision of the Rangers.,Saddar SP Tauqeer Naeem said the police detained 11 protesters over charges of rioting.,He added the police would obtain CCTV footage from the area to ascertain the identity of the held suspects and if all were found involved in arson, a case would be registered against them, otherwise the innocent bystanders would be released.,Inspector General Police AD Khawaja has taken notice of media reports on the incident and asked the deputy inspector general (DIG) south and the DIG Traffic to submit detailed inquiry reports on the matter, and summoned them separately.

481,2017-11-24,D.I. Khan assault case,"Last month, in a remote village in Dera Ismail Khan, a teenage girl’s ,. ,Setting out one morning to perform the mundane task of getting water, she was abducted, stripped naked and forced to walk through her village. Now, it has emerged that she might be further victimised by the apparent existence of footage of the spectacle. ,The news of this assault shocked the nation, even making international headlines. But the media spotlight and the victim’s petition to the Peshawar High Court has once again exposed that, for all of Pakistan’s legislative progress, women still face immense obstacles to accessing justice, particularly for gender-based crimes. ,Despite legislation to protect women, a lack of sustained willpower to implement reforms has, day by day, ossified the weaknesses of the criminal justice system in supporting victims, and the wilfully regressive, all-too-prevalent mindset of treating women as pawns.,At the community level, women must contend with the brutality of the male-constituted jirga system that uses them as bargaining chips in resolving disputes and sanctions ‘punishments’ against them. ,While apparently not directly involved in this assault, the local panchayat did arbitrate over a dispute between the victim’s and the main suspect’s families years ago. That the situation only escalated — from the accused kicking the victim’s mother then, to assaulting her now — is indicative of the culture of impunity for violence against women perpetuated by such alternative forms of ‘justice’. ,At the police level, women contend with uncooperative officers who often prevaricate and minimise such attacks as petty rivalries instead of calling them violent crimes. ,Consider that the victim’s mother claims she was initially prevented from registering an FIR, and that when it finally was registered later that day, the victim was pressured to lessen the charges. Curiously, within this interim, the police registered another FIR — this one against the victim’s brother. ,Finally, at the political level, victims are forced to witness elected officials use their clout to settle political scores instead of protecting their vulnerable constituents. Often running their parties like jirgas, politicians have themselves been complicit in curtailing women’s constitutionally guaranteed rights. ,Expecting women to negotiate all these obstacles after being victimised is inhumane. ,The rot is deep, and only if the state demonstrates its absolute commitment to investigating and prosecuting every such crime, free of prejudice and external pressures, can we call ourselves a just society."

In 2008, ATC-V was shifted to Badin and the case was transferred to ATC-II for trial.,The then judge of ATC-II had indicted all the accused on May 4, 2009. They denied the charges levelled against them and opted to contest the case. But the prosecution had not examined even a single witness till August 2010, when accused Mohammad Amin filed an acquittal application under Section 265-K of the Criminal Procedure Code. After hearing arguments from both sides, the court allowed the applicant’s plea and exonerated him of the charge for lack of evidence.,Following the acquittal of the accused, the court framed the amended charge against the remaining three accused in September 2009.

But no evidence was recorded till Nov 20, 2009 when the two-year contract of the then judge expired.,The case remained pending before the dysfunctional ATC-II for over 15 months and finally it was transferred to ATC-I. The ATC-I had recorded the evidence of around 20 witnesses till March 2013. Then the case was sent to the ATC in Sukkur, which recorded the evidence of around five witnesses. After around two years, the case was sent back to Karachi in ATC-VII, where the judge has so far examined around 25 witnesses.,According to the prosecution, the massive bomb blast took place near the stage when participants in the 12th Rabiul Awwal congregation were offering Maghrib prayers at Nishtar Park on April 11, 2006.

He told Dawn that none of the senior police officers and local parliamentarians visited him in the hospital nor did the police department offer any assistance. ,Mr Hayat, whose left elbow was fractured during the incident, said after the sit-in was called off the kidnappers put them in an ambulance and took them to Sohan area in the dark and threw them in the bushes alongside the road. ,They somehow reached a village where villagers offered them a glass of water and a meal, but they asked a taxi driver to take them to the Sadiqabad police station, Mr Hayat said. ,He said two more people - one of whom was probably a local PML-N leader’s driver and the other one was a government official - had also been detained in a makeshift tent by the religious protesters. He said: “It was no less than a miracle that they didn’t kill us.” "

506,2017-12-05,Few answers for the families of the disappeared,"			
,As the days passed by, Muhammad Ali* was getting fed up of living. Handcuffed and often fettered, he could hardly sleep in his small cell. Screams from nearby cells would often keep him awake. ,He was taken into custody by some unknown personnel of some unknown intelligence agency from a North Karachi neighbourhood in late spring this year. “Many people wearing masks and clad in civilian clothes came to my house in about 15 vehicles. They broke through the main entrance, entered the house and made all male members of my family stand in one corner. They searched the house thoroughly and collected books, papers and some other things from my bedroom. Then they took me out of the house,” he says. ,They blindfolded Ali, covered his head with a piece of cloth so that nobody could see or recognise him and put him in a vehicle that immediately sped away. After a journey lasting about half an hour, he was taken out of the vehicle. He was made to wear clothing made of an uncomfortable nylon-like material. “Then they started slapping me in the face,” he says. The slapping went on for quite a while. He was subsequently helped down some stairs and pushed into a small room, he says. ,“The next morning, [they took me] to a different room and threw a volley of questions at me, accompanied by kicks and punches. They asked me questions about my life. They also asked me which organisation I belonged to,” he says. “For a number of days, I would receive severe beatings and abuses on a daily basis. I was often kept awake at nights and told to stand up for hours. Sometimes, I would be told to do squats ceaselessly if I wanted to avoid being subjected to electric shocks.”,The beatings and abuse stopped after about 10 days. His blindfold was also removed. He could finally see that he was living in a five-by-five foot room, wearing an orange jumpsuit. A closed-circuit camera watched him constantly in the cell and he noticed, through the grilled portion of the bottom of his cell’s door, that someone was constantly marching in the corridor. “Sometimes I would see the feet of other prisoners while they were being taken to a washroom” — a door-less compartment where the detainees were tied to a hook as they relieved and washed themselves, while a guard kept a close watch on them all the while. “All the officials always had masks on their faces,” he recalls. ,For the 40 days that Ali spent in detention, he was considered a missing person by his family. ,It was not his first experience of going missing, although, according to him, it was the longest and the hardest time he had spent in detention. An activist of the Ahl-e-Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ), he has been detained three times in about one-and-a-half year, he says. “I am amazed why there is no coordination between different intelligence and security agencies. After one of them lets me go, another picks me up.” ,Ali recalls how he was told during his latest detention to confess that he belonged to Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, an anti-Shia terrorist group with ideological affinities with ASWJ. His captors wanted him to help them arrest other anti-Shia militants. “In return, they promised to give me money and help me settle abroad,” he claims. “I could offer them no help since I do not have any links with any terrorists.”,Aquib Khan Swati, a 24-year-old undergraduate student associated with ASWJ, was taken into custody from his residence near Baloch Colony off Sharah-e-Faisal road in Karachi during the early hours of August 17, 2017. He remains untraceable.,“A policeman accompanied those who put my son in a four-wheel truck. They also took away my mobile phone as well as that of my wife,” says his father, Shaukat Swati, a retired employee of K-Electric. The family is native to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Hazara district.,The family of Muhammad Aslam, another missing ASWJ activist, also came to Karachi from the same province but from a different region (Balakot in eastern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) when he was a child. As he grew up, he started teaching the Quran at a madrasa in Scout Colony, a working-class locality in Karachi’s Gulshan-e-Iqbal area, where he also lived. He would sell caps and prayer beads to earn extra money. 
On December 14, 2013, a group of people came up to him near a mosque in his neighbourhood and took him away.,“Those who took my husband with them were accompanied by officials of the Sindh Rangers,” says his wife, Sobia Aslam, who was given the news through eyewitness accounts. “I dialed his cell phone number the night he was abducted but it was powered off. The next morning, some unknown callers started calling me. They threatened me of dire consequences if I tried to trace my husband or raise my voice for his recovery,” she says. She was warned that she too would become a missing person if she made any effort to find Aslam. “Those calls continued for several days,” she says. ,Aslam was 32 years of age when he went missing. His wife, who teaches the Quran to children in her neighbourhood, and his only daughter, who was eight years old at the time of his disappearance, are both hopeful that he will come back home one day because, as Sobia says, “He did not commit any crime.” But they have also prepared themselves for the worst. “If they have killed Aslam, they should tell us so that we stop dreaming about his return.” ,			
,Danish Aqeel Ansari left for Lahore on a business trip on August 26, 2013 according to his family. A day later, he reached his destination and called his mother. Then his phone went silent. Eight days later, on September 3, two people visited his house in Karachi’s Gulistan-e-Jauhar area. “They introduced themselves as the officials of an intelligence agency and told us that Danish was picked up [by their agency from some place] near Punjab University in Lahore and that he was in custody,” says his elder brother Munir Aqeel Ansari, who works as a journalist in Karachi. “They did not tell us why they had picked him up but advised us not to make any efforts for his recovery as he would be freed in a couple of months,” he says. “We remained tight-lipped, hoping he would be released.”,Six months went by and Danish did not come back. “It was then that we approached the Sindh High Court and different human rights organsiations for his recovery,” says Munir. ,During his student years, Danish was a member of the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, a student association affiliated with the Jamaat-e-Islami. ,Another former Jamiat activist, 26-year-old Saad Siddiqui, was taken away from his home on June 11, 2015. “A month later, four officials of the Sindh Rangers brought him back to his house,” says Usman Moazzam, general secretary of Pasban, the Jamaat’s estranged youth wing. “He was badly injured and wasn’t able to even walk. They searched the house and then also took me and my younger son Muhammad Siddiqui with them.” He continues: “They blindfolded both Muhammad and I and kept us together in a cell. Saad was being kept somewhere else. They did not beat me up but would torture Muhammad.”,After about a month, Moazzam’s detention was made public, but he was kept in custody for another 90 days and was later sent to jail. He was released in early 2016 after he was implicated in what he calls false cases, including one over helping criminals receive treatment from a hospital owned by former federal minister Dr Asim Hussain, who himself is facing multiple cases of terrorism and corruption. “I had never met Dr Asim Husain till then.”,Law enforcement agencies showed his son Muhammad to still be in their custody in December 2015. He is still in jail, facing charges of terrorism. “My sons are innocent,” says Moazzam. “As far as I am concerned, it is true that I went to Afghanistan in the early 1980s under the patronage and protocol of the state when jihad in Afghanistan was a noble cause for our state. Now perhaps they are punishing me and my sons for that.” ,Muhammad Aamir Khan, a lawyer in Karachi, has dealt with the cases of around 20 former Jamiat associates who went missing between 2013 and 2017 — all but three of them have come back home. Two who did not return, Aliur Rehman and Abdus Salam, are facing death sentences after their conviction in military courts for the 2015 assassination of social activist Sabeen Mahmud, as well as a deadly attack on a bus carrying members of the Ismaili community in Karachi’s Safoora Goth area the same year. A third suspect was killed in a police encounter. ,During their detention, Khan’s clients were interrogated about their links to people whose photos they were shown. They were also made to call some of their friends who were perhaps wanted by the agencies, he says, but adds that none of them were tortured. “They were kept in temperature-controlled rooms, given proper meals and were also allowed once a week to walk in the premises of the detention centres. They were even provided books that they had asked for.” ,When they were released, says Khan, they “were provided a phone number to make complaints if they were ever harassed by anyone claiming to be from the intelligence agencies”. When one of them received threatening calls, he called the number. “The calls stopped after that,” he says. ,All of Khan’s clients are highly educated. Many of them are said to have visited Afghanistan in 2012 to fight against American forces there. Most of them were impressed by the teachings of the late Dr Israr Ahmed, a Lahore-based preacher who broke away from the Jamaat when it decided to take part in electoral politics. He set up his own organisation, Tanzeem-e-Islami, and advocated for a global Muslim caliphate. ,The Jamaat generally remains silent over such disappearances. Zahid Askari, its information secretary in Karachi, says the party does not want to associate itself with anyone involved in militant activity that is no longer endorsed by the Pakistani state. ,But the party made an exception for Musab Abdullah, a former Jamiat activist and information technology expert, who went missing in Karachi last month. The Jamaat demanded his release, particularly through social media statements. This is because Abdullah was not involved in any unlawful activity, says Najeeb Ayubi, a Jamaat leader in Karachi. “He was earlier taken into custody one-and-a-half years ago but was released,” Ayubi adds. ,			
,In any case, he says, his party does not endorse the forced disappearance of members of any party or group. Law enforcement agencies should present any suspects before the courts of law, instead of turning them into missing persons, he believes.  ,The cases of 30-year-old Hamza Shahid*, who was pursuing his family business before being taken away by unidentified men on August 3, 2017 at 2:15 am, and 24-year-old Nabeel Akhter – a chartered accountancy student who went missing on September 15 this year – look different in many ways. Shahid, a married man with two children, was taken into custody during a night raid on his house by a score of masked men in civilian clothing in Karachi’s Defence area; while Akhter, a bachelor, went missing from Gulshan Chowrangi in the same city a little after 8:00 pm. Nobody knows who took him away or how. ,The efforts their families have launched for their recovery, however, have taken a similar trajectory. ,In the first instance, the Gizri police station registered a first information report (FIR) on August 29 on the orders of the Sindh High Court. The police then wrote letters to different law enforcement and intelligence agencies as well as the chiefs of all prisons in the country for help obtaining “information [about] and search[ing]” for Shahid. The police also sought the record of his cell phone and published adverts in newspapers, asking people to share any information they may have about him. The Sindh Home Department has set up a joint investigation team (JIT) to investigate the case. Its first meeting took place on October 18 though it did not make much headway.  ,In the second case, Akhter’s employers, a Karachi-based chartered accountancy firm, S M Suhail & Co, confirmed in a letter that he had been at work till late in the afternoon on the day he went missing. His father, Mohammad Jameel Akhter, wrote a letter to the Sindh High Court’s chief justice, requesting him to direct the relevant civil, paramilitary and military agencies “to locate [his] son and to produce him from the illegal detention of the abductors”. It was on the court’s orders that an FIR about Akhter’s abduction was registered at the Gulistan-e-Jauhar police station on September 17.  ,His family, too, sought access to his phone record, enlisting help from the Citizens-Police Liaison Committee and the Sindh Rangers. The only thing they could find was that Akhter had made his last call at around 8:00 pm near Disco Bakery in Gulshan-e-Iqbal. His mother says the call was made to a friend who he was scheduled to meet and who has also gone missing since that evening. ,His family later received another, though equally unhelpful, piece of information. On October 11, the Gulistan-e-Jauhar police station and the Counter Terrorism Department Karachi told the Sindh High Court that they do not have Akhter in their custody. ,There is another similarity between the two men: they were both quite religious — like any other Muslim, the latter’s mother puts it. But their parents and relatives deny that they had any association with militant ideologies or extremist organisations. ,In the early hours of December 16 of last year, unidentified men got down from several vehicles inside the Kashmiri mohalla of the Gulbahar locality in Karachi’s Rizvia Society. While local residents were asleep, the men bolted all except one house in the neighbourhood. The lone house they spared belongs to Zahid Haider Kashmiri, a peon at a local community school. He was also an organiser of Shia mourning processions, says his wife Andaleeb Zehra. “We did not hear any noise before the men broke into our house,” she recalls. ,Zehra woke up to the sound of her bedroom door being kicked open at around 3:00 am. “I panicked and found many men standing inside the room.” They took Kashmiri outside the house, along with his cell phone and identity card. His face was covered with a cloth and he was made to sit in a car. “Some of the men blocked my way until the car sped away,” she says. ,Immediately afterwards, her three children, all aged under 10, sprang into action and unbolted the gates, waking up local residents. By that time, Zehra says, “it was too late”. ,Since that night, the family has known nothing but fright while going to bed. “My children sleep holding onto me. They are still so shaken that I have to console them every single night,” she says.  ,			
,Zehra has contacted as many as 15 different law enforcement agencies and human rights organisations to no avail. The Sindh High Court could help her to the extent that Rizvia Society police station, on the court’s orders, registered an FIR about Kashmiri’s disappearance on August 28, 2017 — nine months after he went missing. ,Ghazala Jafri and her family experienced something similar. At 3:00 am on the night of November 15, 2016, several masked men dressed in civilian clothing broke into their house, located near the Jafria Imambargah in Gulshan-e-Iqbal’s Hussainabad area. ,“When I rushed out to see what was going on, I saw somebody jump into the house,” Jafri says. The man asked her for the key to the main gate. Frightened, she handed it over. He opened the gate, locked from inside, and let the rest of his companions in. After checking the identity documents of the men living on the ground and first floors, they proceeded to the second floor where Jafri’s brother, 40-year-old Sheeraz Haider, lived along with his wife and three-year-old son. They checked his identity card and took him out of the house. They said they would set him free after some questioning. He did not come back. His family does not know where he was taken or if he is still alive. ,“He was one of the five people to have gone missing from our neighbourhood, all in the same way,” Jafri says. Another of the missing, Hussain Ahmed, is her nephew. He was taken away the same day his uncle, Jafri’s brother, went missing.,Razia Perveen, Haider’s wife, sent a handwritten letter to the chief justice of Pakistan the next day, requesting him to take note of her husband’s disappearance. “We still don’t know … which agency [has] arrested him,” she wrote, and sent copies of the letter to the director general of the Sindh Rangers, the chief justice of the Sindh High Court and the inspector general of Sindh Police, among others. Except for a Sindh High Court order for the registration of an FIR, which police complied to on October 11, 2017 (11 months after Haider was taken away), nothing has worked.  ,Haider had been working with the Sui Southern Gas Company Limited for about 17 years on contract, and was also enrolled in an MBA programme at the Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science and Techonology. He would leave work by 6:00 pm and go directly to university for his classes, his sister says. Since he was free from work on Saturday and Sunday, he would go to university at 9:00 am on weekends and stay there till 6:00 pm, she adds. ,Haider could have been detained for travelling to Iraq or Syria to fight against the forces of the Islamic State (IS). His sister denies this. He never went abroad, she claims, not even for a pilgrimage. ,From political activists to the associates of religious and sectarian organisations, missing persons in Karachi come in all ideological hues and stripes. Umar Mavia, a spokesperson of the ASWJ in the city, says 24 local members of his organisation have disappeared since 2013. Ten of them went missing in 2017 alone. All remain untraced, he says. Majlis Wahdat Muslimeen, a Shia political party, claims 19 Shias belonging to Karachi have gone missing since 2015. Two others who were detained from the city belong to Parachinar. ,The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQMP) also claims that 127 of its members have been picked up in Karachi by law enforcement agencies as well as unknown assailaints since 2013. “During the last 10 months, 45 MQMP activists went missing,” says Gul Faraz Khattak, a leader of the party. ,The Defence of Human Rights Pakistan, an organisation headed by Amina Masood Janjua whose own husband has been missing since the early 2000s, has recorded the cases of 119 people who went missing from Karachi in the last 12 years. These cases mostly concern those who have been taken away due to their alleged association with religious militancy. Only 30 of them were released, four were found to be in the custody of law enforcement agencies while four others were found dead. The whereabouts of another 81 remain unknown.  ,Asad Butt, chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), says all the different numbers given by different organisations do not portray the whole reality. No organisation maintains  comprehensive data, he says. Each one mostly records cases of people who are ideologically close to it, he adds. ,In many cases, the families of missing people do not come out to have their complaints registered, but work silently for their recovery. In the ongoing year, says Butt, about 20 Shias have gone missing in Karachi but the cases of only six of them have been reported to HRCP. “Overall, more than 100 people have disappeared from the city this year but HRCP has received only 43 complaints.” ,Justice (retd) Dr Ghous Muhammad – a member of the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances, which was set up in 2010 under orders from the Supreme Court – also mentions problems in ascertaining the exact number of missing persons. The commission, he says, received 1,141 complaints in total from Sindh, but 245 out of them were deleted because they either did not have complete addresses of the missing persons or they pertained to people who had deliberately disappeared to avoid the law or due to personal reasons. However, he says, the commission has successfully traced 781 of the people reported to it as missing from the province. “One hundred and fifteen cases remain to be traced.” ,The number seems to be too small to capture the growing problem of missing persons in Sindh in general and Karachi in particular."

508,2017-12-06,Senior officials claim Justice Najafi report ignored police narrative,"LAHORE: Senior police officers who were part of the 2014 Model Town incident declared the Lahore High Court tribunal report “a superficial analysis” rather than a realistic approach. ,An officer remarked that the report had been prepared on the basis of public, media and political pressure, setting aside the “genuine narrative” of police. ,“We had not launched the operation with ill intentions, rather to maintain public order,” he claimed, adding police only retaliated in self-defence. ,He further said the report had not mentioned anywhere the intentions of the charged workers of the Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) despite knowing that they had taken police officials hostage and subjected them to severe torture. ,“I believe the media was also at fault as usual to get ratings. Most news channels had presented distorted facts by editing footages, showing police’s brutality and protesters’ innocence,” he alleged. ,The official claimed that police possessed a lot of footage of the charged activists of the PAT who could be seen torturing policemen, but the media deliberately concealed this aspect which prompted the force to retaliate. ,“It is a self-contradictory observation and we believe the report will demoralise police force in maintaining law and order,” another senior police officer said on anonymity. ,He maintained that the commission had blatantly ignored the armed assault of protesters on police. The commission should have recommended anti-terrorism charges against the protesters who attacked law enforcement agencies. ,“Police reacted in self-defence when news spread that a group of charged protesters had killed some officials and taken many of them hostage,” he claimed, adding that the report surprisingly missed this important aspect of the incident. ,Police did not act willfully; the situation had become very critical when PAT workers resorted to attacking the police force, a senior officer, who had led the 2014 operation, said. ,“It is an incident not a criminal assault,” he said, adding that the law enforcement agencies had immunity to use force for security of lives and properties of the public during such alarming situations. Unfortunately, he said, police in Pakistan were a frail wing of the state. ,“We have taken up the issue with the high command of the Punjab police to take serious steps for security of police officers/officials in the wake of the Model Town report becoming public,” said another senior officer. ,He said the report had sent a wave of disappointment among police force. Officers identified in the report are expecting a strong reaction against it from the higher authorities to ensure it does not affect the morale of the force. ,Note: Police officials quoted in this new story did not want to be named owing to the sensitivity of the matter."

519,2017-12-08,Boy kidnapped on Wednesday from Karachi's DHA released after payment of ransom,"KARACHI: A five-year-old boy who was kidnapped from Defence Housing Authority on Wednesday afternoon in the presence of his mother was released in the early hours of Thursday after the criminals received ransom money from his family, according to police and Citizens-Police Liaison Committee (CPLC) officials.,Mohammad Abban Ghufran was kidnapped from DHA Phase-8 near an academic institution while returning from school with his mother on Wednesday, said CPLC chief Zubair Habib.,He told Dawn that two masked men in a white car intercepted the vehicle in which the boy and his mother were travelling and after snatching valuables from the woman they took the boy away with them forcibly. Shortly after the boy’s family received a call from the kidnappers who demanded a ransom of Rs150 million for his release, he said, adding that after negotiations with the family the kidnappers had agreed to take Rs300,000.,He said after receiving the ransom money the kidnappers had left the boy at Askari petrol pump near Jauhar Chowrangi.,Kidnappers said to be ‘educated’ individuals,Soon after the kidnapping of the boy, the Sindh governor taking notice of the incident directed the CPLC and law enforcement agencies to take action for his early recovery.,Mr Habib said soon after receiving information about the kidnapping a joint team of Rangers, police’s Anti-Violent Crime Cell and the CPLC launched investigation into the incident.,He believed that it was the pressure of the officials’ prompt action that the kidnappers had agreed for negotiations with the affected family.,The CPLC chief said that in the cases of children’s kidnapping the priority of his organisation was safe recovery of abductees, adding that the payment of a “small amount of ransom money does not matter much”.,Talking to Dawn, Crime Investigation Agency DIG Saqib Ismail Memon agreed with the views of the CPLC chief, saying that in the cases of kidnapping the priority of officials was safe recovery of victims.,He claimed that the kidnappers of the boy were educated people. “The case is not closed,” he said, adding that the police had got some leads and they were working on it to arrest the kidnappers.,Answering a question, the CPLC chief said the cases of kidnapping in Karachi had declined sharply. Three years ago, he added, around 200 people were kidnapped annually in the metropolis. He recalled that before the launch of Karachi operation, a total of 174 cases of kidnapping for ransom were reported in Karachi in 2013.

520,2017-12-08,UN calls for probe into Taser assaults in US jails,"GENEVA: The UN special rapporteur on torture has urged US authorities to investigate and weigh criminal charges against jail officials in Ohio, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Arkansas for the clearly gratuitous infliction of severe pain and suffering from the use of Tasers on inmates, citing a report published this week.,After reviewing footage of jail incidents, Nils Melzer said the grave abuse from Taser use in some US jails violated the United Nations prohibition on cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and, in some cases, amounted to torture. He cited video footage of 22 incidents in four jails: in Ohio, Tennessee, Arkansas and Oklahoma states.,In my view, all of the incidents shown in this video require independent investigation and most of them are likely to merit prosecution, Melzer said in an interview. Clearly gratuitous infliction of severe pain and suffering constitutes a grave violation of human dignity and of the universal code of conduct for law enforcement officials.,His criticisms were echoed by the head of the United Nations watchdog panel that monitors US compliance with an anti-torture treaty, who said the cases documented by Reuters need to be investigated thoroughly.,In an article and accompanying video report published Wednesday, Reuters identified 104 cases of prisoners who died after being shocked with Tasers. Some of the in-custody deaths were deemed multi-factorial, with no single cause, and some were attributed to pre-existing health problems. But the Taser was listed as a cause or contributing factor in more than a quarter of the 84 inmate fatalities in which the news agency obtained cause-of-death findings.,Of the 104 inmates who died, just two were armed when shocked and nearly 80 percent hadn’t been convicted of a crime. A third were in handcuffs or other restraints when stunned. In more than two-thirds of the 70 cases, the inmate already was immobilised when pinned to the ground or held by officers.,When you use a tool like this on an incapacitated person, to me it certainly amounts to cruel and degrading treatment, Melzer said.,A weapons manufacturer, Axon Enterprise, said stun guns can help jailers and inmates avoid injuries when used properly. Axon issues guidance on proper use and warns of the risks associated with its weapons, but the company said it is up to local jail administrators to set their own policies on how and when the weapons are deployed.,We do not condone torture of any kind, Axon spokesman Steve Tuttle said in response to Melzer’s call for an investigation. Our technology is designed to protect life and reduce harm to all parties involved during high risk, violent, and response-to-resistance situations.,Melzer agreed Tasers can be a justifiable tool for prison guards as an alternative to a gun to incapacitate a person who poses a threat.,Melzer cited two of the 22 cases identified by Reuters to explain his belief that an investigation is warranted. One was the 2009 stunning of Martini Smith at a jail in Franklin County, Ohio. Previously unpublished video footage showed the Tasers electrified darts striking the womans chest.,Smith, who was pregnant and lost her baby after being stunned, was one of nine inmates who filed a lawsuit against the county. Guards used Tasers at least 180 times from Jan 2008 to May 2010, often on prisoners posing no threat, the lawsuit contended.,In its own reviews, the sheriffs office found no wrongdoing by guards and said the Taser use did not constitute excessive force.,That looks like a case of torture, Melzer said. She was threatened she would be Tased if she didn’t comply with an order. It’s not that she physically resisted or would have been dangerous to the officer.,The Smith footage was among dozens of videos examined of Taser incidents at the Ohio jail. Nineteen were featured in the video story. Melzer said they revealed grave abuse. No deputies at Franklin County have been charged.,The prosecutor’s office of a country said the US Department of Justice did not recommend criminal charges against jail officials when the justice department intervened on behalf of inmates in the civil lawsuit stemming from the Taser incidents.,The department “at no time treated these incidents as criminal conduct”, the office said in a statement, noting that plaintiffs’ lawyers and expert witnesses in the case also did not recommend criminal charges.,Melzer also cited footage obtained of deputies in a jail in Cheatham county, Tennessee, who repeatedly stunned 19-year-old Jordan Norris on Nov 5 last year, while he was strapped to a restraint chair. That footage also was evidence of torture, Melzer said.,One deputy, Mark Bryant, was charged in September with four counts of aggravated assault and one count of official misconduct. Bryant has pleaded not guilty. Neither he nor his lawyers could be reached for comment.,Jens Modvig, chairman of the UN Committee against Torture, a panel of 10 independent experts, also said the documented incidents represented blatant abuse that may violate laws. The United States, as a signatory to the UN Convention against Torture, is obligated to investigate the cases, he said.

528,2017-12-10,"Breaking wills, broken souls","			
,The first slap is expected although the terror is about where it will come from. ,The first insult hurled is ‘normal’ but the pounding humiliation isn’t. ,The first time silence can be deafening but later on, it is music to the ears of many.,Another incident of alleged brutality inside a Lahore prison has surfaced. Despite official proclamations to the contrary, those who have already suffered at the hands of law enforcement seem to suggest that torture inside Punjab prisons remains an ongoing tragedy…,Welcome to Punjab’s prisons — home to some of the most brutal practices of torture employed by law enforcement. There is much happening inside jails but there are barely any answers, certainly not from behind those silent, imposing walls that seem to swallow anyone who enters. ,And yet, those who have gone to jail — for just or unjust reasons — return with tales of horror forever etched in their memory. There is fear of physical torture and the feeling of vulnerability. There is utter helplessness and defencelessness. And there are no messiahs to save the day. ,This story is a collection of experiences from former convicts and under-trial prisoners (UTPs). Almost all accounts narrate the fear of the unknown; those who were once defiant of the law suddenly have the tables turned on them. And those who were once respectful of the law suddenly find disdain for how the criminal justice system works. ,MEETING THE TORMENTOR,Sohail Yafat’s eyes have lost their shine. A former convict, he was arrested in 2001 for murder under an FIR registered by ‘unknown persons’. After undergoing some dreadful torture in physical remand and then in the Crimes Investigation Agency (CIA), he was sent to the notorious Sahiwal prison as a UTP. Upon conviction he was transferred to Kot Lakhpat Jail, Lahore. It took 10 years for him to be eventually exonerated. ,But even today, as a free man, the memories of the violence that he both experienced firsthand and witnessed in jail shackle him. He is passionate about many things but somewhere deep inside, a hollowness remains — a feeling that is common to those who have spent time behind bars. ,“The worst thing in the world is to hear someone crying with pain, yet knowing you cannot even lift a finger to help,” says Yafat. He is among the few former convicts to come on the record for this story. When he was first convicted, life had turned upside down for him — what will happen to his loved ones, how will they survive, will they be able to sustain pressure from society, will anyone believe in his innocence, and of course, what hell is awaiting him inside prison. ,The decade that he spent in incarceration, however, seems to have changed his outlook on life. In his words, he has witnessed the depths of savagery that mankind can stoop to. ,“It starts with mulahiza,” says Yafat of a prisoner’s first introduction to torture at jail. ,Mulahiza [literally ‘inspection’] is an interview with the superintendent of the prison. A group of new prisoners gathers in the courtyard, the scene is something akin to newly enrolled students gathered at a school assembly. But instead of a principal or headmaster, the jail superintendent confronts the prisoners. One by one, the prisoners are called out to appear before the superintendent. ,“You stand in front of the superintendent, with two men on either side and one behind you,” recounts Yafat. The three surrounding men are usually prisoners but they can also be jail wardens, according to him. ,“Questions are shouted out by a deputy superintendent. With every answer the prisoner gives, he receives a slap on the nape of the neck. It comes unexpectedly at first — and with full force.” The slap is called a ‘thaap’ and nobody is exempt from it.,The mulahiza questions are mostly about personal information and the alleged crime. If a prisoner protests or struggles, he is roughed up some more. The extent of torture depends on the superintendent’s style as an administrator. ,“I have seen people bleeding after the mulahiza,” says Yafat.,Another former Sahiwal prison inmate, who wishes to remain anonymous, says that newcomers usually wait the night out, in a place colloquially called the ‘nursery ward’. ,“The mulahiza happens early the next morning,” he narrates. ,A medical officer (MO) first examines the prisoner, recording the identification marks and evidence of prior violence. Then the deputy superintendent starts barking out the questions.,“The thaap is meant to subdue a prisoner’s ego and to show him who’s in charge,” he says. “They are basically telling the newcomer to forget about the freedoms of his life outside.”,But Yafat says his worst memories from jail are not of the thaap. They are of hearing cries of agonising pain. It all began with a riot.,THE INFAMOUS INMATES’ RIOT,“I saw two prison riots, both at Sahiwal Central Jail,” says Yafat. “The first happened after a prisoner, Bashir Hanjra, was taken to the punishment block and tortured to death. But the second one was much more violent.” It took place on November 14, 2002. Various prisoners’ accounts point at several reasons.,According to one, junior prison staff orchestrated the riot using some of the prisoners. Several prisoners, who wish to remain unnamed, relate that the then superintendent, Salik Jalal, was pushing for a strict enforcement of rules to end corruption. Prison staff stood to lose considerable income from a well-established system of favours. They say it is routine for prisoners to pay for various facilities and freedoms. According to a couple of accounts, the riot was provoked through talk of a convict’s death from torture.,Others blamed the cruelty they said many prisoners had suffered at the hands of Deputy Superintendent Rai Muhammad Arif. They said mulahiza was the worst under him. He would also frequently order those he wanted to punish into ‘scooter’ position — standing as if riding a motorbike. If somebody fell from fatigue or stumbled, he would beat them up and make them resume the posture.,Arif was set upon by several prisoners during a routine round of the factory area and taken hostage using carpet makers’ tools. Yafat remembers seeing him being led to the top of the control tower. “Next thing, they were trying to force him into the same scooter position.” ,Regardless of the reasons, the riot was quite violent while it lasted. And so was its aftermath. ,“I saw one of the UTPs walking into one of the control rooms and a warden hit him really hard with a stick on the back of his head,” remembers Yafat. “He literally somersaulted and fell across a water trough. An assistant superintendent rushed over and stopped the warden from hitting him again.”,“I remember one of the wardens beating a prisoner with a pipe,” says Yaseen Bajwa, another former prisoner. “The prisoner was then taken inside the ‘chakkar’ and tortured some more. Once the riot started, some of the prisoners broke through one of the under-construction walls of the barracks that separated the condemned prisoners from the rest and broke their locks.” He says the jail resembled a battlefield, with every man looking out for himself.,Things got so out of control that the Punjab Elite Force was called in. ,“Usually the administration does not allow firearms on the premises on account of the possibility of a prisoner gaining control of one.” says Bajwa. “But they did not hesitate this time and there was a lot of blind firing. I saw a death-row prisoner shot down. He was merely sitting on the barracks wall, watching what went on.”,			
,A newspaper report says that in November 2002, condemned prisoner Muhammad Ejaz was shot dead, and 39 others were injured when police opened fire to quell a battle between prisoners and jail employees. Another report — this one published in Dawn — makes the claim that a dispute arose when jail staff tried to shift a prisoner. ,“The dispute soon turned into rioting and the prisoners started pelting stones in anguish,” claims the report. “They broke the cells of the condemned prisoners, and freed around 150 prisoners and rushed towards the main gate to climb it.” ,The riot eventually stopped with the jail superintendent negotiating with the prisoners. ,Late that night, both Yafat and Bajwa say, the lights went out throughout the jail. A troupe of jail personnel then came to the barracks and read out a list of names. They led away some of the prisoners.,Bajwa says they were taken to various areas in the jail to be tortured as punishment. Yafat says he remembers their screams.,“The whole night I could hear them howling like banshees, separated it seemed by only a wall,” he recounts. “In the morning, there were splashes of blood and clumps of hair ,at several places. God knows what was done to them!” ,He says he also saw pieces and splinters of the sticks they were beaten with. ,Bajwa says he and a cousin were among those beaten up. “I was beaten to a pulp. My cousin lost an eye and his calf bone was smashed,” he says. ,Next, some of the prisoners were transferred to other jails under what is known as a ‘qusoori challan’ — alluding to the central role played by the accused in an act of indiscipline and disobedience.  This is a standard procedure in all jails.,What happens under a qusoori challan is that a notification is issued by a jail superintendent to transfer a prisoner to another jail for “administrative reasons” such as overcrowding. This is then approved by the Inspector General of Prisons, a small formality in the larger scheme of things. ,But the truth is less sanitised. ,The qusoori challan is often misused and abused as a form of inflicting greater torture to an inmate. The accused are taught a lesson in disciplining at another prison, often in a separate block constructed for torture purposes. In fact, the punishment block is essentially a jail within a jail. At the Sahiwal Jail it is called the Saat [7] Block at Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat it is referred to as Chalees [40] Chakki. There are other names for it at other prisons. Under prison regulations, a prisoner is to be kept segregated if he becomes a threat to others or if he has misbehaved (Section 28, Prisons Act, 1894). Most of those sent there have caused commotion or led riots. But, inmates say, jail officials wield discretionary power to send anyone there. ,“A prisoner’s blood curdles at the very mention of the Punishment Block,” says Ibrar Shah, previously a munshi at the central control room. “By the time they reach there, they are already in pretty bad shape from the torture.”,			
,Jalal, now DIG Headquarters (Prisons) says that no torture followed the Sahiwal Jail riot. “There were some bad elements, who did not like me for enforcing the rules,” he says. “I was probably the first to see that a new menu was introduced.”,Jalal says that some of the prisoners regularly had food brought from their home until the authorities took notice of this and tried to stop the practice by improving the food inside. Most of the prisoners were fine with that, he says. He says there were exceptions. “They were addicted to their own oil and ghee toppings,” he says. ,“The riot was also a reaction to my efforts to control corruption. These things happen when you try to straighten the crooked.”,While most former convicts agree that the condemned prisoner who was killed in the Elite Force action was merely sitting on the wall watching the riot, Salik maintains that he was trying to escape. “There were others as well climbing the wall. That is construed as jail break. Action is taken accordingly.”,He insists that there was no follow-up torture.,CONDEMNED ONCE AGAIN,A Dawn report from November 25, 2002, said that those involved in the Sahiwal Jail riot were still being tortured. The report said that they were not allowed any visitors and that some of them had been transferred to other prisons. ,“Many of them were in a bad state after the torture,” remembers Yafat. “We heard that some of them died on their way while being taken to other facilities. Of course, official records would never show how they actually died.”,Salik was asked for the record for the purpose of this story. His response: “It cannot be found.” ,Mian Farooq Nazeer, until recently inspector general of Punjab Prisons, says that there is no question about any form of torture in jail. “We have a zero tolerance policy for corruption and for torture,” he says. “Such practices may have been rampant in the past. I tried to enforce the rules.”,He says there are two types of problems inside jails, one is an organised corruption racket and the other is corruption on an individual level.,“It is easier to catch the organised racket but not so simple to stop individual wheeling and dealing,” he says. “Whenever such a case comes to light, we dismiss the officer involved immediately. Recently, I have dismissed some people from the Multan jail.”,He claims that authorities do not resort to physical violence unless a prisoner is aggressive and asking for it. “In such cases, we have the right to defend ourselves if the prisoner is being aggressive.”,But Dr Khurram Sohail Raja, general secretary of the Pakistan Society of Forensic Medicine, says that he has seen cases of torture in custody throughout his time as a medico-legal professional.,“In Faisalabad district alone, there are over 200 cases of police torture a year — and these are only the reported cases. These include cases from jails,” he says. ,In the past six months, says the doctor, there have been four reported cases of jail torture. And on Wednesday, December 6, 2017, the family of a Lahori man who died in police custody alleged that he was tortured to death by his jailers. Police officials insisted, however, that he died “due to his drug addiction”.,Dr Raja recalls a previous case, that of a man who had both his thigh bones broken by prison staff. Many cases, he says, are never presented because it has been too long or because there are no visible injuries. Most victims never take up their cases in court. Criminal lawyers, who meet inmates on an everyday basis, also rubbish the claims that torture is a story of the past. An advocate who wishes to remain anonymous says he has handled several cases of juvenile crime. He says that the claim of a Pakistani prison without physical and mental torture, including sexual violence, is “laughable”.  ,			
,Tariq Siraj, a Sialkot-based lawyer, says he saw some dreadful things in jail after he was framed by a political rival. ,“One of the most horrifying cases of torture I know of was when a drug mule was tortured,” he says. “He had brought a contraband package hidden in a body cavity. When the jailers found out, they sodomised him with vegetables sprinkled with spice.”,Such extreme actions are rare. But then there are other, more common, methods. ,For instance ‘falakka’ — the beating of soles of the feet with a cane — is quite frequent. This is preferred by law enforcement personnel because the marks of such torture are less easy to spot. There is also strappado — when a man is left hanging by his arms. This can result in the dislocation of shoulders. Another form of torture popular with jail staff is ‘jahaaz banana’ [make into an aeroplane]. The victim is held in the air by four people, each holding a limb while two others beat him with a ‘chhittar’ [whip] made out of tyre rubber. ,“You get really disoriented,” says Siraj, who says he was beaten up, though mercifully only with hands. ,“The superintendent was paid a large amount of money to torture me,” he alleges., Another form of torture is ‘kawwa banana’ [make into a crow] — where a person squats, bending forward, with a rod passing through behind the knees. The victim is kept in the posture for hours, hampering blood circulation. ,Former prisoners say they saw this in both Kot Lakhpat and Sahiwal prisons. ,WHY THEY DO IT,While torture at police stations is meant to force confessions and supposedly facilitate investigation, in jails there are other reasons for it. First of all, there is the failure to prosecute the perpetrator. This and the rampant criminal economy are a deadly mix. ,There are those who readily pay for the smallest of facilities and those who do not. They are made to pay by setting an example: ‘see what happens to those who don’t pay.’,The jail insulates not just the prisoners but also the wardens and the superintendents from the world outside. A prison guard is not a very powerful man in the world outside, but inside he wields incredible power over people. ,A central issue around the phenomenon of brutal torture inside jails is that, despite international pressure, Pakistan has no law which criminalises torture. ,“Some of the jail staff simply loves to torture prisoners,” says Siraj. “I won’t paint everyone with the same brush, but when there is a system of abuse, it starts being accepted as standard. Yes, the police are guilty of a lot of abuse, but the prison staff ... they think they can get away even with stealing your death shroud.”, A jail official notorious for torture, currently stationed at the Adiala Jail, was known as Chacha Giddar Kut. Prisoners remember him as a man who revelled in torture. ,“He used to carry a baton and his hand would never be still,” says Yafat. “When he was not hitting a prisoner, he would be poking or hitting anybody who was passing by. When no one was within an arm’s length, he would start hitting his own boots with it!”,The unique problem with the jails is that their secrets are more likely to remain within their walls. Kot Lakhpat is often even called Kot Lakh-Laanat [Kot ‘Cursed’] by the prisoners. They say, after three years of being behind bars, a prisoner feels the fatigue within him; after five years he himself becomes a tormentor. Many convicts are thus used to abuse other prisoners. ,Organised corruption, too, supports torture. Those with money and influence can pay their way out of torture. They can also pay for a little extra fresh air, a little more movement across the barracks and the use of cell phones, even drugs. ,LEGAL RIGHTS (AND WRONGS),The legal framework of the prison system has been inherited largely from British India. ,“The British in India were using this prison system as an instrument of punitive measures instead of a reformative centre in order to suppress freedom fighters and other political opponents,” according to Human Rights Violations in Prisons by Assistant Professor of Law Muhammad Zubair and Sadia Khattak (2014) of Abdul Wali Khan University.,“Even the UTPs face staggering levels of torture under judicial custody,” says lawyer Saroop Ijaz, the Country Representative of Human Rights Watch (HRW). ,A central issue around the phenomenon of brutal torture inside jails is that, despite international pressure, Pakistan has no law which criminalises torture. ,“Usually Article 14 of the Constitution — “Dignity of Man” — is used and interpreted to constitute as protection against torture,” says Ijaz. “This is because there is no specific law, not even a definition of torture, especially in sync with international laws.”,Section 337-K of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) provides punishment for torture as 10 years in prison, but torture remains undefined. The UNCAT (United Nations Convention Against Torture) came about in 1987. Pakistan ratified it in 2010. An anti-torture law was drafted but never approved. ,The lawyer explains that despite there being a provision in the PPC regarding “Mistreatment of Authority”, very rarely is anyone convicted. More than anything, torture is viewed as a ‘disciplinary offense’ rather than as a crime. Combined with outdated colonial laws and rules which are meant to keep the population in check rather than reform them, this creates a very enabling environment. ,More importantly, there is also a doubtful system of addressing complaints. ,“If a prisoner has a grievance, he can only complain to the jail superintendent or the district judge,” says Ijaz. “Once convicted, the prisoner hardly comes to court so he is cut off more or less. Meanwhile, the jail superintendent is an interested party, so complaints can’t really be fleshed out if they reach him. There is always an incentive to keep them hidden so controversy can be shunned. [Complainants] can petition the court — but there is a failure of the judiciary, because rarely is any action taken.”,The HRW representative suggests that lawyers should be able to call for independent medical examinations, or the court itself should be recognising torture signs, but the fact is that torture is usually done in such a way that no obvious signs are left. ,“The point is that there are ways around [the barriers to complaining], but most cost money,” says Ijaz. “And if you have money then you’d most probably rather pay it inside the jail so that they don’t torture you in the first place.”,Another method is for legal aid itself to reach out for inmates and help them, rather than waiting for them to come out and ask for help. , “We formed a network of more than 20 organisations called the Anti-Torture Alliance (ATA),” says Bushra Khaliq, focal person of ATA. “We developed the draft anti-torture bill through a series of discussions and consultations with parliamentarians and lawyers among several others. It was an all-encompassing law covering all aspects of custodial torture, but the matter remains in limbo.”,The Senate of Pakistan passed the Torture, Custodial Death and Custodial Rape Bill in January 2015 after it was moved by Senator Farhatullah Babar in August 2014. The National Assembly was supposed to take up the Bill next but did not. “Thus criminalisation of custodial torture is still an unfinished agenda in Pakistan,” she laments.,Meanwhile, Yafat’s life has a new chapter. Prisoners are known to age fast and Yafat wants to make the most of his experiences. ,“I was one of the fortunate ones in terms of the physical pain I went through,” says Yafat. “Still, sometimes it feels as if my soul is shattered.” ,There is redemption of sorts in his work as a criminal defence investigator with a legal aid organisation named Justice Project Pakistan, where he deals with complaints of torture in jails. A full recovery, he says, may take the rest of his life.,According to the United Nations definition, the term torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him/her or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.,The writer is a member of staff. She tweets "

543,2017-12-13,Silencing dissent,"			
,RAZA Khan, a young civil society activist, is the latest addition to a long list of those subjected to enforced disappearances. He has been ,. His family and friends believe he has been detained by the security agencies. His crime is that he has a thinking mind and idealises regional peace and coexistence, something that is unacceptable to the self-appointed guardians of our ideological frontiers. ,In this atmosphere of fear, few dare to raise their voice against the witch-hunt. There is a criminal silence from our legislators over illegal detentions that are no more restricted to the conflict zones. Many more people are now being picked up from cities for reasons never disclosed. Some of them may have returned home after suffering torture, but many others have not been so lucky. No one knows what crime they have committed or are even accused of. ,Raza is among the scores of victims of the latest wave of what is widely seen as state-sponsored disappearances. It has been reported that he is the seventh civil society activist to go missing from his home this year. In January, , in Islamabad and cities of Punjab. ,Apart from one, who remains missing, they returned to their homes within two months after protests from rights groups and pressure from the international community. They were reportedly tortured in detention. Moreover, a systematic campaign was launched on electronic media accusing them of blasphemy, thus putting their lives at risk.,The indiscriminate use of coercive power by the state to silence dissent undermines national solidarity.,Last year, security agencies allegedly abducted from Karachi Abdul Wahid Baloch, a progressive man of letters who also worked as a telephone operator. He returned home after four months and was so shaken that like the others he would not speak about his ordeal. Obviously, no action would be taken against those responsible for his unlawful detention. ,Another high-profile case of suspected enforced disappearance is that of Zeenat Shahzadi, a young journalist who was abducted by armed men in Lahore in August 2015. She had been investigating the disappearance of Hamid Ansari, an Indian national. While there were ,, nothing has been heard of her since. Her younger brother was so traumatised by her disappearance ,. ,Raza in his late 30s had reportedly formed a group called Aaghaz-i-Dosti, a platform to further the cause of peace between India and Pakistan. The group collected paintings and letters made and written by schoolchildren focusing on the themes of peace and coexistence. The paintings were published in calendar form. He was also active with a group working for environmental protection. One wonders how any of his activities could have threatened national security. ,Raza may come back as happened in the case of most of the bloggers. But the real question is whether we have any rule of law in this country. No legal recourse seems to be in sight for the families of missing persons — a euphemism for those allegedly abducted by the security agencies. A recently published Amnesty International report rightly described the rising number of enforced disappearances as a “blight on Pakistan’s human rights record”. ,According to the report, hundreds and possibly thousands of cases have been reported across the country over the past several years. “Victims of enforced disappearances are at considerable risk of torture and other ill treatment and even death. To date, not a single perpetrator of the crime has been brought to justice,” the report said. ,What is most alarming is that the number of missing persons has marked a massive rise this year under democratic rule. The Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances set up by the government received nearly 300 complaints of alleged enforced disappearances from August to October 2017, by far the largest number in a three-month period in recent years. ,Although most of these victims belong to Balochistan, there have also been reports of a large number of political and rights activists having been allegedly picked up by the security agencies in Sindh. Some were released after sometime, but the fate of the others is uncertain. It is a pity that the national media reports only a few of these incidents. ,It is despicable when a state meekly surrenders to a group of blackmailers resorting to violence in the name of religion but uses strong-arm tactics against people who dare to speak their mind without breaking any law. A narrow and twisted interpretation of national security comes in handy to silence them. ,There have been some recent reports of a crackdown on Facebook pages supporting diversity of association, thought and expression in the country. Many of these pages have been shut down and their moderators face threats. Such illegitimate actions are often justified in the name of national interest undermining democratic and basic human rights enshrined in the Constitution. ,It would have been more prudent to allow the law to take its course if someone is engaged in any wrongdoing. Justice must not be denied on any pretext of national security. In fact, the indiscriminate use of coercive power by the state to silence dissent undermines national solidarity and integrity. ,We have seen how such a repressive approach has caused alienation in Balochistan, creating favourable conditions for the insurgents and for foreign intelligence agencies to meddle. The recent wave of enforced disappearances is particularly alarming as the military authorities claim to have contained the insurgency. ,Now this wide-scale crackdown on rights activists demonstrates the continuing impunity of the security agencies despite protests inside and outside the country. The enforced disappearance of Raza and so many others before him highlights how dangerous the country is becoming for rights activists and for those who dare to raise their voice against excesses perpetrated by the state.

550,2017-12-14,Despair over disappearances,"			
,THE Senate Functional Standing Committee on Human Rights has endorsed Senator Farhatullah Babar’s campaign for the creation of a new, competent and adequately powerful commission to deal with enforced disappearances. The government will invite indictment for complicity if it does not heed this call on a priority basis.,The Senate committee is not the first to ask for a strong commission on disappearances. Over the past two months, the Supreme Court has repeatedly censured the authorities for their failure to deal with what has surely become a festering sore. The UN Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearance and the UN committees scrutinising Pakistan’s compliance with its obligations under the various human rights instruments have also been asking for strengthening the existing Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances. These advices were disregarded when the life of the COIOED was recently extended.,The issue of disappearances was studied by a commission of three retired superior court judges and after looking at the issues related to disappearances and holding numerous hearings for eight months, it submitted its report on Dec 31, 2010. The government’s failure to publish the commission’s report has aggravated the hardships of the ‘missing persons’.,Victims’ families suffer in silence in the hope that they will thus be saved from collecting dead bodies.,Some of the commission’s findings published by a newspaper, and never denied by anyone, indicated that it held the government responsible for illegally detaining at least some of the ‘missing’ persons and ordered payment of compensation. The commission was reported to have criticised the police for booking the victims of enforced disappearance on concocted charges after they were handed over to them by the authorities that had been holding them unlawfully. While recommending legislation to legalise the working of intelligence agencies the commission went on to suggest a lawful procedure for detaining anyone. The commission’s recommendations have been ignored, except for the one that called for the establishment of a new commission to continue dealing with enforced disappearances.,Thus, the COIOED started functioning on March 1, 2011, with 136 cases it had inherited from the commission of judges. By Nov 30 this year, it had received 4,378 new cases. Obviously, even judging by reported cases, that are believed to be fewer than the actual number, the phenomenon of enforced disappearances has not ended. At the end of last month, the COIOED had no less than 1,498 cases pending before it.,To be fair to the COIOED, it did try to fulfil its task and a major part of the blame for its inability to deliver must be accepted by the government for it did not grant COIOED the stature, the skilled personnel and the financial resources it needed.,While the COIOED’s practice of circulating a monthly performance report is welcome, the information this report offers is inadequate. For instance, the report for October 2017 said that Zeenat Shahzadi, the Lahore journalist and human rights defender, had been recovered and reunited with her family but she did not accept the commission’s invitation to appear before it. For the commission, the matter ended there. Could it not send someone to see Shahzadi and ascertain whether she had really been freed and to record her statement?,In her last contact with the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, Shahzadi’s mother said that she and her daughter were staying at an Islamabad hospital and that Shahzadi was having a session with a psychiatrist. It should not be impossible for the COIOED or the government or even the Islamabad commissioner to trace Shahzadi and find out who is denying access to her. If during her abduction/ detention for two years, her health has seriously deteriorated the government has a duty to ensure that she gets the best possible medical treatment.,Nothing has been said by any authority about the non-state actors that are said to have abducted her. Was she recovered from the clutches of her abductors or did they throw her by the roadside? Has any one of her abductors been arrested or identified? Is her case on the active list of any federal, provincial or local authority? All these questions need to be satisfactorily answered if the government wishes to be accepted as a responsible entity. The National Commission for Human Rights has now taken up her case. Let us see how effective the NCHR’s intervention will be.,Now civil society is worried about Raza Mahmood Khan, a Lahore-based peace activist who disappeared last week. Since his activities were never secret and his lodgings were searched and ransacked by apparently professional hands, the authorities have a good trail to follow.,It is said that the victims of enforced disappearance refuse to talk about their ordeal. They might be afraid of reprisals. For the same reason, many cases of disappearance are not reported. The families of victims suffer in silence in the hope that in this way they will be saved from collecting dead bodies from a ditch or a ravine.,But one man has not remained silent. Nasir Shirazee, a leader of Majlis Wahdatul Muslimeen, was recently released by his abductors after three weeks of detention. A couple of newspapers have carried his account. He too was told to keep his mouth shut. According to him, he was picked up because he had been talking about disappearances. Let us see what action will be taken on his disclosures. His decision to narrate what happened to him encourages the hope that if persistent efforts are made many more victims of enforced disappearance may become bold enough to tell their stories. The greater the number of people who speak out, the easier might the end of disappearances become.,Much else needs to be done beside the creation of a strong, statutory commission. The judges’ recommendations of 2010 should be implemented and the international convention on disappearances ratified. Finally the government must discover its will to make enforced disappearance a part of history."

The judicial magistrate, however, rejected the IO's request. ,Subsequently, the IO approached the sessions judge south requesting physical remand of Khawar Burney. He told the judge that police had not completed their investigation regarding the prime suspect, and said that the police would be able to arrest the absconding suspects with his help. ,The sessions judge then ordered Khawar Burney be sent on physical remand for two more days. ,Investigators have also stated that Khawar Hussain Burney, the main suspect in the case who was ,, has a history of ""violence and interest in arms"" and strongly suspect his involvement in a similar incident sometime back.,SSP South Javed Akbar Riaz had told , that the suspect had told police that following Dr Raheem's accident, he and his friends thought that their colleague had died.,He had quoted the suspect as saying that they chased Zafir and Zaid and their vehicles had hit each other during the chase, but the victims had not stopped.,The suspects had said that they then continued their chase and opened fire on the tyres of the victims' cars, but the indiscriminate firing resulted in the tragedy.,The accused had claimed that he was in a ""fit of rage and became hyper"" since he thought the motorcyclist had been killed in the accident.

558,2017-12-18,It's time Pakistan banned the two-finger test for decoding consent in rape trials,"2017 will go down in history as the year mainstream discourse on sexual violence was finally forced to confront the universal impunity enjoyed by perpetrators of assault.  ,Unfortunately, these global developments have failed to trigger any corresponding debate on the inability of Pakistan’s criminal justice system to provide redress to survivors.,In a country where conviction rates for rape are less than 4% and the National Police Bureau records an average of over 3,000 reported cases every year, the need for gender-sensitive legal and policy reform has never been more critical.,In recent years, any attempts to end impunity have focused on the introduction of piece-meal legislation,  which whilst important for political visibility of the women’s movement, has failed to translate into increased conviction rates. ,: ,Key amongst the reasons underlying the limited impact of legislative developments in sexual assault is the central role played by gender stereotypes and biases in judicial proceedings in Pakistan. ,From the time of the registration of the complaint by the police to the sentencing of the perpetrator, whether or not the victim’s character is in line with what is deemed ‘chaste’ or ‘pure’ has a far greater bearing on the outcome of the case rather than the nature of the violation she has suffered. ,Stereotypes pertaining to what is a ‘good woman’ remains the primary consideration for police, prosecutors and judges to decide whether or not a victim’s claim of rape deserves reliance. ,In many ways, the decision to come forward and report the crime is the first instance where the criminal justice system begins to view the victim with suspicion. ,It is presumed that a woman with honour would never bring shame upon herself by admitting that she had been raped.  A ‘true victim’ in many ways is one that never comes forward.  ,: ,Under the ,, lack of consent on the part of the alleged victim is the primary ingredient for categorising an act of intercourse as rape. ,The existence of consent or lack thereof cannot be objectively quantified and thus it falls on the judge to decide whether or not to believe that a victim’s account is reliable. ,Reported judgments are littered with references to a victim’s ‘loose morals’ and ‘easy virtue’ which are taken as irrefutable evidence that she consented to the alleged act and thereby rendering her testimony as false.  ,For instance, the Lahore High Court in , (2008) disregarded the victim’s rape complaint as “she appeared to be a woman of easy virtue [and] indulged in sexual activities”.,Similarly in another decision by the Federal Shariat Court in 2006, the accused was acquitted of all rape charges as the “victim girl was of easy virtue and though she was unmarried and of 16 years, but had lost her virginity”. ,The determinative nature of the victim’s character to judicial decision making is reinforced by reliance on outdated ‘medical’ tests called two-finger rape tests. ,A relic of British India, the archaic test involves inserting two fingers into the vagina of the victim in order to determine whether or not she is “habituated to sexual intercourse”. ,The test is not a legal requirement but a medical practice that has become part of legal jurisprudence.,The affirmative findings of a test i.e. deeming the victim to be habituated to sexual intercourse if her vagina admits two fingers, are relied upon by courts to presume consent.  ,Thus a woman with a sexual history is assumed to consent forever more and therefore can never be raped.  ,For instance, the Lahore High Court in , (2008) refused to rely upon the statement of the victim as the “medical report revealed that hymen of victim was torn and vagina admitted two fingers easily”. ,On the other hand, the Lahore High Court accepted the testimony of the victim in , (2009) as “vagina admitted two finger tight fully and painfully which showed that sexual intercourse had been firstly committed with her [committed for the first time] and further that she was not a woman of easy virtue and was not used to committing sexual intercourse” [explanation added]. , ,Former British colonies including India, Malaysia and Bangladesh have progressively began banning reliance on these tests. ,There is a growing recognition that not only is there no scientific link between the laxity of one’s vagina and sexual history, a victim’s ‘character’ is irrelevant on the alleged act being adjudicated upon.  ,Additionally, in order to protect victims, most countries have promulgated character-shield laws that bar the introduction of evidence pertaining to the character or sexual history.,However, not only does Pakistan continue to hold on to the two-finger test but its victims must withstand aspersions on their character and sexual histories during the course of the rape trial which often lasts for several years.  ,In fact, the character of the victim is the primary accused in the trial, with the conduct of the accused being a secondary consideration. ,It is thus little surprise that not only are convictions low, but victims themselves prefer to reach informal settlements with accused rather than put up with a trial. ,Legal and policy reform barring gender stereotypes pertaining to the character of the victims from legal proceedings on sexual assault is urgently needed. ,Whilst social norms pertaining to acceptable behaviour will not change overnight, the criminal justice system has an obligation to institute gender-sensitive mechanisms that provide adequate redress to victims without subjecting them to additional violations of their privacy and dignity.  ,Only then can the recent legislative amendments achieve their desired impact.

559,2017-12-19,Judicial probe into Naila Rind case termed incomplete,"HYDERABAD: The petitioners in the Naila Rind alleged murder case have termed “incomplete” the probe report submitted recently to Sindh High Court Hyderabad circuit bench by a sessions judge on the Sindh University student’s death, seen by the victim’s friends and relatives as murder. ,Inderjeet Mal, one of the petitioners who had approached the Hyderabad circuit bench of the SHC in the wake of Naila’s mysterious death, said in the objections filed in SHC through Ali Palh advocate on Monday that the report had missed many vital links in the case. ,He said the report did not discuss the first FIR lodged by police under an outdated ordinance of 2009 that indicated inefficiency and mala fide intentions on the part of police. ,The report failed to notice what Naila was doing in the hostel during holidays. It quoted hostel warden Mehjabeen as claiming that Naila had come to obtain leave but did not elaborate on why the leave was being sought and whether it was for visiting home or a friend or for some other purpose, he said. ,He said the report noted that some girls were present in room No. 21 but failed to give their names nor did it treat them as witnesses. Their statements were also not recorded by the judge, he said. ,The petitioner said that at line No. 7 on page No. 9 of the report the room where Naila was staying was mentioned as 36-A of undergraduate hostel and at another place it made mention of only room No. 36 “which was not sealed” but failed to provide reasons why it was so because it risked destruction of vital pieces of evidence hitherto uncollected. ,He said the report talked about blank strips of anti-anxiety pills found in a dustbin in the room but failed to probe this aspect in detail. Statements of two roommates of Naila were also not recorded, he said.,Nisar Rind, Naila’s brother, had hinted at harassment as well as threats his sister was receiving from someone but the report did not make any attempt to find out that person and failed to say what kind of mechanism was available in the university for dealing with the issue of girls’ harassment, he said.,He said the report did not say what kind of forensic or digital tools were used to collect additional pieces of evidence which were not part of the earlier investigation by police. ,Mr Mal said the report was silent on the fact that parents had complained to media about marks of violence on Naila’s body. ,At page 19 the report referred to a messaging group of male and female students of the university but failed to explain if there existed any mechanism for handling harassment of a girl through such means of communication. ,The report gave hanging as cause of her death but did not say if she had committed suicide, he said. ,After receiving the petitioners’ objections, the division bench comprising Justices Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Khadim Hussain M. Shaikh adjourned the matter to Dec 28 for further proceedings. "

564,2017-12-19,Retrial of Shahzeb Khan murder case commences in Karachi,"A sessions court in Karachi on Tuesday began conducting the retrial of the Shahzeb Khan murder case as per the Sindh High Court's order. ,On November 28, the high court had revoked the punishments previously awarded to Shahrukh Jatoi and three others in the case and ordered a retrial. The SHC had made the decision while hearing a criminal review application filed by Shahrukh Jatoi's lawyer, Advocate Farooq H. Naek, in August 2016. ,In 2013, an Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) had awarded the death penalty to co-accused Shahrukh Jatoi and Siraj Talpur for Shahzeb's murder. Siraj's younger brother, Sajjad Ali Talpur, and his servant, Ghulam Murtaza Lashari, had been handed life sentences.,A couple of months after the sentence, however, Shahzeb's parents had issued a formal pardon to the convicts. The pardon was approved by the SHC ─ as was pointed out by Sindh prosecutor general at the last hearing at the high court.,As the retrial commenced today, the sessions court was informed of the pardon and sought a report on the pardon from the high court.

Sajjad Talpur and Ghulam Murtaza Lashari, the Talpurs’ servant, were handed life imprisonment for their involvement in the murder.,An application — filed on behalf of the victim’s family in the SHC under Section 345 (2) of the Criminal Procedures Code, asking the court to allow the convicts and the legal heirs of the victim to settle the matter out of court — has been pending disposal.,Initially, the case (FIR 591/12) was registered under Sections 302 (premeditated murder), 109 (abetment) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of the deceased’s father. However, during the investigation, Section 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the PPC and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 were incorporated in the FIR.,The episode started with the harassment of accused Lashari with the victim’s sister. She stated in the trial court that Lashari had hurled indecent remarks at her as she was about to enter her 11th-floor apartment upon her return from a wedding.,The teenage girl deposed that she immediately phoned her mother about harassment from the Talpurs’ servant. The girl’s mother stated in her deposition in court that she immediately sent her son home as his sister was in trouble.,The victim returned and had an altercation with Lashari, which led to a quarrel between him and the accused persons. The victim’s mother tried to pacify the situation and directed her son to tender an apology.,The victim did what his mother asked him to do, but the accused persons did not accept the apology, saying that they would be satisfied only if Lashari, who had been employed as a cook by the Talpurs only two days before the incident, was allowed to slap the victim.,On hearing those terms, the victim’s mother directed her son to leave the place. Immediately after Shahzeb's departure, Shahrukh Jatoi had taken out his pistol and threatened that he would kill Shahzeb.,After the four co-accused in the case had also departed, the victims’ parents went to the apartment of the two accused Talpurs’ father, Nawab Imdad Ali Taplur, to settle the matter.,However, the accused persons meanwhile intercepted the victim at Karachi's Khayaban-i-Bahria and shot him dead.,Two friends of the victim, Muhammad Shah and Muhammad Ahmed Zuberi, who had chased the accused persons fearing an assault, witnessed the incident and deposed in court accordingly.,The two friends stated in court that Shahzeb rolled over and rested on a side after he was fired upon. Nawab Sajjad Ali Talpur and Ghulam Murtaza Lashari then walked up to the victim’s car and asked Shahrukh Jatoi to kill the victim as he was still alive.,Jatoi had then fired more shots at the victim, ensuring his demise."

The counsel also moved the court for the immediate signing of their release orders, which were issued forthwith. ,Shahzeb Khan's father, Aurangzeb Khan, had earlier in the day asked the sessions court to not only release the four men earlier convicted of his son's murder on bail, but also drop the case against them completely. ,He argued that , and asked that their decision be upheld.,			
,Pakistani law has a maximum punishment of the death penalty, or life in prison for a murder. But, under Islamic laws of Qisas and Diyat, the victim's families can strike an out-of-court deal with the murderers. In that case, the victim's families generally appear in court to testify that they have pardoned the murderer in the name of God. However, Shahzeb's family had waived their right to Qisas and Diyat and told the court they had reached an out-of-court compromise with the accused's family.,An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) had earlier , for 20-year-old Shahzeb's murder in 2012 following a petty dispute. Siraj's younger brother, Sajjad Ali Talpur, and domestic helper Ghulam Murtaza Lashari had been handed life sentences.,A couple of months after the sentence was passed, however, Shahzeb's parents had issued a formal pardon for the convicts, approved by the Sindh High Court (SHC).,Despite the pardon, however, the death penalty had been upheld because of the addition of terrorism charges to the case. ,However, the , and ordered a , in a sessions court after a , argued that terrorism charges should be dropped as the prime suspect was a juvenile at the time of the offence. ,The retrial ordered by the high court had commenced last month.,In a previous hearing of the case, , Shahzeb's family to submit the pardon documents verified by the high court.,The sessions court had also sought a verified copy of the high court's order to revoke the punishments against the accused.,As per the court's orders, Aurangzeb had appeared on Saturday to submit a copy of the pardon. The report on the SHC order to revoke the ATC's sentence was not presented at today's hearing. ,Aurangzeb claimed that after Jatoi and his accomplices were awarded a death sentence by an ATC, he, with consent from his family, had reconciled with the convicts. ,""We forgave Shahzeb's murderers for the sake of Allah,"" he stated. ,Shahzeb's murder in 2012 had prompted then chief justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry to take ,, which had sparked outrage across the country as people questioned if the prime suspect — who belongs to the powerful Jatoi family — would ever be held accountable for their actions.,The heavily scrutinised trial had seemingly concluded when an ATC awarded the death penalty to Jatoi and Siraj Talpur and life sentences to Siraj's younger brother, Sajjad Ali Talpur, and domestic helper Ghulam Murtaza Lashari in June 2013.,In August 2016, however, Jatoi's lawyer — Advocate Farooq H. Naek — filed a criminal review application in the SHC, claiming that the offender was a juvenile when the crime was committed and, therefore, the terrorism charges he was tried under should not have been applied.,After hearing Naek's appeal, the SHC had set aside the ATC's death penalty and ruled that a section of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 1997 had been misapplied by police as the case seemed to concern a personal vendetta. ,The high court subsequently ordered a retrial and referred the case to a session court. ,The episode had started with the harassment of the victim’s sister by Lashari. She stated in trial court that Lashari had directed indecent remarks at her as she was about to enter her 11th-floor apartment upon her return from a wedding.,The teenage girl deposed that she immediately phoned her mother about the harassment from the Talpurs’ servant. The girl’s mother stated in her deposition that she immediately sent her son home to help his sister.,The victim returned and had an altercation with Lashari, which led to a quarrel between him and the accused persons. However, the victim’s mother later tried to pacify the situation and directed her son to tender an apology.,The victim did what his mother asked him to do, but the accused persons did not accept the gesture, saying that they would be satisfied only if Lashari, who had been employed as a cook by the Talpurs only two days prior to the incident, was allowed to slap the victim.,On hearing those terms, the victim’s mother directed her son to leave the place. Immediately after Shahzeb's departure, Shahrukh Jatoi had taken out his pistol and threatened that he would kill Shahzeb.,After the four co-accused in the case had also departed, the victims’ parents went to the apartment of the two accused Talpurs’ father, Nawab Imdad Ali Taplur, to settle the matter.,However, the accused persons meanwhile intercepted the victim at Karachi's Khayaban-i-Bahria and shot him dead.,Two friends of the victim, Muhammad Shah and Muhammad Ahmed Zuberi, who had chased the accused persons fearing an assault on their friend, witnessed the incident and deposed in court accordingly.,The two friends stated in court that Shahzeb rolled over and rested on a side after he was fired upon. Nawab Sajjad Ali Talpur and Ghulam Murtaza Lashari then walked up to the victim’s car and asked Shahrukh Jatoi to kill the victim as he was still alive.,Jatoi had then fired more shots at the victim, ensuring his demise.,Initially, the case (FIR 591/12) had been registered under Sections 302 (premeditated murder), 109 (abetment) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of the deceased’s father.

586,2017-12-23,A prison of our own making,"			
,IN Shakespeare’s Hamlet, the prince greets two visitors to the royal court by asking what they have “deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither?” Surprised, one visitor asks what he means by ‘prison’. Hamlet says, “Denmark is a prison.” The other visitor comments that if so, the whole world is a prison. Hamlet says it is, and “a goodly one, in which there are many confines, wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o’ th’ worst”. The other visitor disagrees. Hamlet’s reply is profound: “Why, then, ‘tis none to you, for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.”,Raza Khan, a social activist, went missing in Lahore on Dec 2. His fault? The courage to express his opinions openly, invoking the wrath of the invisible, dark forces who consider themselves above the law. The message for him and others of his ilk is clear: you are no longer safe in your own homes. It is better to be silent and cow before the forces of darkness. “But we will not be silenced,” said the select group of lawyers and activists at a recent press conference, adding that “we will use every single platform we have available to agitate” against this latest case of enforced disappearance.,Raza is the seventh activist to go missing this year. Before they returned to their homes, for up to two months the others were ‘imprisoned’, silenced and disgraced for advocating for causes they believed in. Their bodily bruises may have healed by now, but their mutilated souls will remain tormented. Raza is the latest ‘prisoner’ apparently taken to purgatory to purge him of views that are perceived as ‘foul’ or ‘seditious’ by the invisible guardians of our national interests. Hopefully, he will return alive to breathe in a wider prison, as in the words of Richard Lovelace, “Stone walls do not a prison make, nor iron bars a cage.” He stands divested of liberty and freedom, and will carry the burden of the beastly behaviour meted out to him.,The deep state is like an unbridled horse, without the reins of constitutional oversight.,This brings me back to Hamlet’s cry, “Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.” Pakistan, too, is a prison for all those conscientious, courageous activists and thinkers who strive to improve the lives of others. Rising above narrow self-interest, they want to promote peace, progress and tolerance. They have a right to dream big. Why should this right be denied? If, consciously or unconsciously, they break any law, the constitutional requirement of due process, fair investigation and transparent trial cannot be denied to them. Unfortunately, Pakistan is not only a ‘prison’ for political dissidents and social activists — it has become an inferno for religious minorities facing persecution and summary prosecution at the hands of bigoted brigades.,My complaint is against the guardians of the Constitution who take an oath to abide by it, ie the state institutions that are letting down the people they serve by acting either as cowards or culprits. Take the police: either they do not register cases of enforced disappearance, or file an FIR against ‘unknown’ culprits while waiting for the victim to be ‘found’ dead or alive. Highly professional, competent senior police officers avoid taking the path where angels fear to tread. Culprits are known, but are considered to be above the law. Why bother to swim against the tide? Based on circumstantial evidence, formal questions are not asked from the heads of ‘secret agencies’. Thus, a culture of impunity is further entrenched among institutions that are not governed under any legal framework.,The other complaint I want to respectfully lodge is with the esteemed judiciary. Why has no suo motu notice been taken of the recent disappearances? The present chief justice of Pakistan himself inquired into the disappearance, torture and death of journalist Saleem Shahzad. He recommended that the intelligence agencies be made accountable and be governed under a legal framework — back in 2011-12. The executive and parliament failed to implement his recommendations. To date, the deep state is like an unbridled horse, without the reins of law or control through judicial or parliamentary oversight.,During the days of judicial activism in 2007, when I was IGP Balochistan, the then chief justice of Pakistan took strong notice of the missing persons issue. Police, civil armed forces and intelligence agencies were made to identify and recover many ‘missing’ persons, and the military regime was forced to cough up many illegally kidnapped victims of state tyranny. ,My recommendation then to the federal government was based on the law: detain the suspects under the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance for up to three months in duly notified lock-ups and commission a probe by joint interrogation teams comprising members of the police’s counterterrorism department and intelligence agencies. Those against whom no evidence was found should be declared ‘white’ and released; those against whom strong suspicion but no solid evidence existed should be declared ‘grey’ and conditionally released with restricted movement; and those against whom sufficient evidence was collected should be declared ‘black’ and prosecuted in anti-terrorism courts — but no illegal detentions at secret locations, please. This was a combination of administrative and judicial processes in view of the extraordinary challenges faced by the state. ,If the judiciary can undertake firm accountability of allegedly corrupt politicians, why should it not take strong notice of transgressions of the executive arms of the state trampling upon the fundamental rights of citizens whose voices are being muzzled by the barrel of the gun? As the year draws to a close, with the spectre of enforced disappearances haunting us all, I say with a heavy heart that we are indeed living in a prison. To me, safeguarding freedom of expression, right of peaceful dissent, avoiding illegal detentions and ensuring due process of law are more if not equally important to combating corruption across the board — including among our sacred cows.

The confession was made during a phone call between Hasan and Saher Shams, a school teacher who turned out to be his second wife.,According to Aryana, Hasan killed his first wife after the couple fought over his second marriage to Shams. ,The IO said that Shams went on to relay the disturbing turn of events to her brother during a phone call.,According to Station House Officer (SHO) Rafay Tanoli, Shams was a friend of the deceased who had an affair with Hasan and then went on to secretly marry him.,""Shams was pressing Hasan for a , now, which compelled Hasan to kill his first wife,"" the SHO said.,Police were suspicious of Hasan's narrative as there was sign of blacking on the temple of the victim, which indicated that the bullet was fired from very close range, the SHO said.,The police cracked the case by going through the phone records of all three suspects — Hasan, Shams and her brother — who have been taken into custody. ,A , where a 20-year-old young woman killed her younger sister, Aleena, with the help of her fiance but initially covered it up with a fake story about a robbery attempt. ,On December 6, it was reported that a 16-year-old girl was stabbed to death and her sister, Alveena, was wounded when they allegedly resisted a robbery attempt in their home.,However, Senior Superintendent Police (SSP) Korangi Nauman Siddiqui later told media that Alveena had confessed to slitting the throat of her little sister after allegedly being blackmailed by Aleena and her friends for several days."
588,2017-12-24,False accusations,"GIVEN the nature of some crimes, exoneration means little except for a vindication of the suspects’ stance and that of their family and friends. So it is in the case of the five bloggers who had vanished into thin air within a short span of time in January and were subsequently accused of having committed blasphemy. ,The FIA on Friday informed the Islamabad High Court that ,. ,Meanwhile, however, their reputations have been dragged through the mud while their families have had to deal with both their disappearance and the death threats hurled against their loved ones. Four of the bloggers who finally surfaced have fled the country in fear of their lives. ,The men had been critical of the security establishment’s policies on social media, and their abduction, never claimed by any organisation, sparked fears that state elements were using enforced disappearance to intimidate civil society activists into silence. ,Matters took an even more ominous turn when a scurrilous campaign on social media accused the five of posting sacrilegious material online. That effectively ensured that any public sympathy for them would evaporate, and their supporters would have to back off lest they were accused of the same crime. ,Blasphemy is perhaps the most emotive issue in this country; even hearsay is capable of provoking murder and mayhem. Not surprisingly therefore, the law can be abused to settle scores, or terrorise an entire community. ,At the same time, even false allegations can usually be traced to a source; this time, however, the identity of the source remains as mysterious as the kidnappers of the five men. What can be said for certain is that the allegations have exacted a terrible cost, as they do always. ,Moreover, the stigma of being accused of blasphemy endures; the question of innocence or guilt is of little consequence. Blasphemy accused have been murdered by vigilantes even following their acquittal, sometimes after they have served their sentence. That makes it all the more imperative that the state itself not add to the hysteria; a responsible approach would be to order that an investigation be swiftly carried out to determine the veracity of the allegations. ,Moreover, as mentioned during the latest hearing of a petition against the bloggers, false allegations of blasphemy must attract punitive measures. Blasphemy is not a charge to be levelled lightly."

Both these laws introduced by the federal government were aimed at protection of women in offences related to sexual abuse, fornication, adultery, etc.,Issues detailed verdict on bail petition of a suspected rapist,The bench ruled that Section 164-B CrPC related to conducing of DNA tests shall be applicable to offences under Section 376 (Punishment for Rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code.,“Coming to the applicability of PPC Section 376, needless to say that it provides punishment of death or imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than ten years or more than twenty-five years and fine for an accused proved guilty of the offence of rape, however, section 164-B Cr.P.C. provides that where an offence under sections 376 or 377 or 377-B of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, is committed or attempted to have been committed or is alleged to have been committed, the Investigating Officer (I.O.), shall proceed for collecting Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid (DNA) samples, where practicable, from the victim with his or her consent or with the consent of his or her natural or legal guardian and the accused during the medical examinations conducted under section 164-A within optimal time period of receiving information relating to commission of such offence,” the bench ruled.,The bench further observed: “It further provides that the DNA samples collected shall be sent at earliest for the purpose of investigation to a Forensic Laboratory, where the same shall be properly examined and preserved.”,“By use of word ‘Shall’ in Section 164-B CrPC, its application has been made mandatory in offence under section 376 PPC,” it added.,In the instant case, the bench observed apparently, the provision of section 164-B of the CrPC had not been complied with, as a sample for DNA test had not been obtained from the alleged victim.,In instant case, the FIR was registered on complaint of husband of the victim, Inayatullah, on Nov 1, 2017, under section 496-A (enticing or taking away a woman), 496-B (fornication) and 376 (rape) of the PPC. The complainant alleged that his wife had gone to the residence of her parents. However, he alleged that she had left that residence with the accused/ petitioner Umar Taj.,Subsequently, the victim was recovered from residence of Umer Taj who claimed that she had gone with him with her free will and they had also entered into wedlock. The petitioner claimed that he was not aware that she was already married.,Subsequently, the victim alleged that she was abducted by the petitioner and also sexually abused.,The petitioner’s lawyer, Shabbir Hussain Gigyani, had contended that the nikahnama (marriage deed) of the petitioner with the victim was duly registered.,The bench observed in its judgment that under Section 203-C CrPC the offence of fornication was non-cognisable and in this regard a complaint has to be lodged in the concerned court.,It was added that the presiding officer of the court taking cognisance of an offence shall at once examine on oath the complainant and at least two eye witnesses to the act of fornication.,The bench ruled that it appeared from record that in the instant case the mandatory provisions as required under section 203-C have not been complied with, hence, in the given scenario, applicability and relevancy of section 696-B PPC (fornication) shall be looked into by the prosecution or trial court at the time of submission of complete challan (final charge sheet) or taking cognisance of the case, respectively."

The court's decision was taken on a criminal review petition filed by Jatoi's lawyer, who argued that terrorism charges should be dropped as the prime suspect was a juvenile at the time of the offence.,""The citizens have been deeply affected and aggrieved by judgement of the SHC whereby terror charges were removed against Shahrukh Jatoi and three others in the case of killing of youth Shahzeb Khan,"" says the press release issued by the appellants.  ,According to the press release, the killing of Shahzeb Khan had “created a sense of helplessness and insecurity amongst the people of Defence/Clifton,” as a car chase and shootout took place on a public road in the densely populated area of Defence Housing Authority. ,""Against the judgement of the honourable Sindh High Court ... [the appellants] also prayed that operation of the said judgement should be suspended, and all four accused including Sharukh Jatoi should be arrested and taken in judicial custody."" ,			
,""It is astonishing that a retrial has been ordered in the case where the trial had been concluded four and half years ago. The sole reasoning given by the SHC is that motive of killing Shahzeb Khan was personal enmity. Since then, all accused have been released on bail,"" the press release adds. ,""It is because of inconsistent application of laws and meddling of power and influence in investigation and prosecution of criminal cases including those related to terrorism that such horrifying acts continue to take place in society where killers roam around with impunity creating a mockery of our laws and justice system continuing to terrorise citizens."",Shahrukh Jatoi and two co-accused, earlier convicted in the 2012 murder of 20-year-old Shahzeb Khan, were , by a court on December 24.,Shahzeb's family had told the court they had reached an out-of-court compromise with the accused's family.,An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) had earlier awarded the death penalty to Jatoi and Siraj Ali Talpur for Shahzeb's murder in 2012 following a petty dispute. Siraj's younger brother, Sajjad Ali Talpur, and domestic helper Ghulam Murtaza Lashari had been handed life sentences.,A couple of months after the sentence was passed, however, Shahzeb's parents had issued a formal pardon for the convicts, approved by SHC.,Despite the pardon, however, the death penalty had been upheld because of the addition of terrorism charges to the case — up until the SHC dropped the charges and ordered a retrial in the case.,The retrial ordered by the high court had commenced last month."

597,2017-12-28,Misuse of blasphemy law,"			
,WHEN the FIA informed the Islamabad High Court the other day that it had no evidence that ,, it did not add anything to the people’s knowledge as they had known this fact all along.,The FIA admission, however, confirms this case as one of the most blatant misuses of the blasphemy law in recent years and as such it merits closer examination. ,Four bloggers — Prof Salman Haider, Ahmad Waqas Goraya, Asim Saeed, and Ahmad Raza Naseer — ,. (A fifth victim was picked up later on.) ,Their abduction and detention had certain unique features. The abductors knew that two of the victims, Goraya and Saeed, who were living abroad would be available in Lahore at the time of their abduction. ,The latter could not have been unknown to the authorities, especially in view of the fact that no ransom was asked for the victims’ release and the questions they were asked were not even remotely related to blasphemy.,Records confirm the extensive use of the blasphemy law to settle personal scores.,Accusing the bloggers of blasphemy was apparently an afterthought. A social media page calling itself ‘Pakistan Defence’ first made such allegations and later on a private citizen was reported to have done so. ,Unless evidence to the contrary is produced it will be impossible to reject the impression that these bloggers were deprived of their liberty and allegedly subjected to torture for their views.,Records confirm the extensive use of the blasphemy law to settle personal scores, to grab the victim’s property or to attack his sect (when prayer leaders of Muslim sects are accused of blasphemy). Indeed, proper research might confirm the view that misuse of the law exceeds its legitimate application!,The government paid little attention to the need to save innocent persons from suffering, and often heavily, for being falsely accused of blasphemy when the much-maligned human rights defenders raised this issue. But it should have woken up when the ,: ,“It is an unfortunate fact which cannot be disputed that in many cases registered in respect of the offence of blasphemy false allegations are levelled for extraneous purposes and in the absence of adequate safeguards against misapplication or misuse of such law by motivated persons, the persons falsely accused of commission of that offence suffer beyond proportion or repair. ,“The majority of blasphemy cases are based on false accusations stemming from property issues or other personal or family vendettas rather than genuine instances of blasphemy, and they inevitably lead to mob violence against the entire community.”,In the same case, the court ruled that criticism of the blasphemy law did not amount to committing blasphemy as had been asserted by a counsel who, incidentally, had been a judge of the high court.,A consensus has thus developed over the past many years that something should urgently be done to protect the victims of false accusations. A few religious leaders, such as Maulana Fazlur Rahman, too, have, off and on, backed such suggestions. ,Some circles have proposed legislation to punish those who falsely accuse anyone of blasphemy. But that will offer little protection to the victim of false accusation. ,For one thing, relief might come to him after much suffering and for another, he could be made to pay for court biases in favour of the person making a false charge. ,What is needed, therefore, is a safeguard against arrest and trial on a false charge.,Such a course was proposed by the National Commission for Human Rights in its submission to the Senate’s Functional Committee on Human Rights.,While forwarding the NCHR’s report its chairman said the following:,“Provisions of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) on offences relating to religion are viewed incompatible with Pakistan’s obligations under the international law, including the guarantees on freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and equal protection of the law ... repeal or substantial amendment in blasphemy laws to bring them in line with Pakistan’s international legal obligations may not be immediately feasible. However, procedural safeguards should be developed to prevent misapplication or misuse of the law relating to the offence of blasphemy.”,The procedural changes proposed by the NCHR are: i) amend section 156-A of the Criminal Procedure Code to include all blasphemy-related offences (295-B, 298-A, 298-B and 298-C of the PPC) with a view to reducing prosecution on false accusations; ii) ensure effective enforcement of Section 156-A of CrPC (investigation of a 295-C complaint by an officer not lower in rank than an SP); iii) ensure that prosecutors/investigators act impartially and pursue only bona fide cases; iv) register cases of perjury against complainants/witnesses whenever required; v) trial of blasphemy accused by sessions courts judges; vi) as a temporary measure, trial under 295-C of the PPC may be made subject to federal/provincial government sanction; vii) Schedule II of CrPC may be amended to make all blasphemy-related cases (Sections 295 to 298-C) bailable; viii) Section 295-A of the PPC may be removed from the list of scheduled offences under the Anti Terrorism Act; ix) there is no reference to repentance in the substantive law, whereas those who repented were forgiven by the Prophet (PBUH).,It may be possible to improve upon these suggestions but they could perhaps serve as the basis of a serious effort to create effective and before-trial protection to falsely accused persons.,For obvious reasons, the bloggers’ case has reignited the administration’s desire to further restrict the space for social media. This matter will be discussed in detail on some other occasion. But it may be necessary to advise the powers that be to develop some tolerance of light-hearted swipes at the authorities who invite attention for their lapses and questionable actions. After all, cartoons and caricatures of the high and mighty authorities are accepted as an appropriate means to remind them of their slip-ups."

Since his disappearance, police, Special Protection Unit (SPU) personnel and intelligence authorities have ,, including the possibility of kidnapping for ransom, drowning, murder and that Mr Liu has returned to his home country.,A senior police official close to the investigation said divers had not been able to find him in the river, while sniffer dogs could not leave the workplace where Mr Liu was last seen.,The official said he may be hiding outside his workplace to return to his home country because he may have been homesick. There were two such cases, in which Chinese workers attempted to escape their workplaces, although they were apprehended and deported later on, he said.,In one such case a year ago, he recalled, a Chinese technician who was working on a development project in Nankana Sahib escaped after telling his superiors he was going to the bathroom.,He said the search for the technician had found him hiding in a house in the village. He had revealed that he was eager to join his family back home. When the matter was brought to the notice of the Chinese consulate in Lahore, the technician was sent back to China.,“It is a possibility that he might be hiding somewhere, but we will not stop searching until we find Mr Liu,” the official said, adding that it had been confirmed that he had not left the country from any airport so far.,The police have detained some people working on the same project, and questioned SPU personnel who were deployed at the project to protect foreign workers, but had yet to make any progress.,They have also been using notables from nearby villages and have been making announcements asking for the police to be informed if anyone has seen a stranger in or around their homes."
599,2017-12-28,DNA testing in rape cases,"WHEN sexual violence is perceived to be almost the norm, the world becomes a dangerous place to be female. ,This observation rings true for Pakistan too. Although the average of 3,000 rape cases reported annually, and a low conviction rate, may appear to diminish the extent of the problem, it must be remembered that crimes of a sexual nature are massively underreported in this country because of the strong social stigma attached to them. ,Observing that perpetrators will be punished if there is incriminatory evidence, the Peshawar High Court noted this week that ,. ,The court, which was ruling on a petition filed by a man accused of sexually assaulting a woman, highlighted the value of medical forensic examinations, including methods used for evidence collection and preservation., ,Pakistan’s anti-rape law makes DNA evidence admissible in court and calls for in-camera trials so victims are protected in court from humiliating questioning. It stipulates DNA samples be taken from suspects and perpetrators for DNA profiling to prevent future attacks. ,Ideally, such DNA samples should be maintained in a national database in case of repeated violations by offenders. Investigators should ensure DNA samples are collected within 72 hours from the time of the incident. ,The realisation that DNA verification can make or break case outcomes is enough of a reason for them and for prosecutors to collect this medico-legal form of evidence. ,Also, notorious for furnishing fudged medical reports, medical officers found colluding with the accused or deciding that a claim of rape is not reliable on a moral whim must be penalised. ,At the heart of failed rape prosecutions lie the inadequacies of investigators and prosecutors who have been unable to provide the evidence required for a fair trial. If the government is committed to pushing back against this culture of hiding violent sexual crimes, then it must institute stringent policies for prevention, legal response and support with immediate effect."
600,2017-12-28,The Raymond rules,"			
,SOME years ago, CIA contractor ,. While the proceedings went on, the US consul-general explained the laws of qisas: an eye for an eye. ,“I gulped,” remembered Davis, “because I assumed this would be my fate.” ,But with qisas came the escape hatch: the laws of diyat. “The victims’ families are going to receive a sum of money,” said the consul-general, “then you’ll be getting released.” ,There’s a troubling change of heart in the Shahzeb Khan case.,Davis didn’t like the plan, but the consul-general assured him, “It’s the best deal you’re going to get.” ,It’s what we tend to miss about qisas and diyat: while it’s a major way justice is frustrated in this country, it’s also one among several to those with means and influence. ,Davis had enablers far beyond the penal code: from Husain Haqqani stamping his visa to Gen Pasha “continually texting [the US ambassador] about the court proceedings”. ,Even exceptions like prosecutor Asad Manzoor Butt, who fought the case with everything he had, were replaced by the state. Thus the system prevailed, and Davis walked free. ,In Shahzeb Khan’s case, we come to the same cruel conclusion. Five years ago last week, Shahzeb was shot four times in Khayaban-i-Bahria, Karachi. Per witnesses, Shahrukh Jatoi was told his victim was still alive. Jatoi shot him again. ,That Shahzeb was the son of a police officer meant nothing when pitted against the spawn of two feudal franchises. It was only when Iftikhar Chaudhry and the Supreme Court got into the act, and thunder rained down from Mount Olympus, that there was movement. The FIR was beefed up with anti-terror provisions. Real arrests were made. For a gent that deserves all the flak he gets, Chaudhry was the reason ,.,But even though diyat was thankfully no longer applicable (by the grace of said anti-terror provisions), the Raymond rules came into play again: game the system hard enough, and you walk away with murder. Especially when the system, i.e., the Sindh government, is your partner. ,First, Jatoi was rushed to Dubai via Bilawal House protocol officers. Then came the Sindh government lobbying the presidency for a pardon. Then came air conditioners and gaming consoles for Jatoi’s prison cell. Then came the defence counsel: Farooq H. Naek, former chairman Senate, former law minister, and lead firefighter for Asif Zardari. ,Finally we come to the saddest twist in the tale: last month, the ,, thus enabling blood money. The family pardoned Jatoi, because it had been broken already. Shahzeb’s aunt says his father was “continuously beaten” and “[taken] to the hospital bleeding”.,Wondrously, it was the very same Sindh High Court that had ruled the opposite earlier: that Jatoi created a “sense of helplessness” in the public, and anti-terror provisions were “fully attracted”. ,Indeed, the anti-terrorism court ruled it was terror in March 2013. The Sindh High Court ruled it was terror in May. And the Supreme Court ruled it was terror in October.  ,But now the Sindh High Court has had a change of heart, in a six-page decision that never discusses its own previous ruling. And even though the Supreme Court has also already deemed it terror, the high court relies on another, wholly distinguishable Supreme Court decision called ‘Waris Ali’. Yet even there, the Supreme Court upheld life imprisonment, unlike the Sindh High Court, which throws out Jatoi & Co.’s convictions altogether. ,Some progressives are hailing this flip-flop, because the jurisprudential definition of ‘terrorism’ seems a far greater cause than ensuring feudal thugs don’t spray innocent kids with bullets. So we cede to the most insipid, limousine liberalism, where words like ‘procedure’ and ‘parameters’ are sung with notes so high, Shahzeb’s family never reaches them. On the other end of the spectrum, some slam the father for yielding to his son’s murderers. They would do better to pray they never have to live a day in his shoes.,But what now? The state won’t file an appeal because it’s in on it. The family won’t file an appeal because it’s made to be in on it. Instead we look to miracles: that the Supreme Court take suo motu notice; that it accept a petition moved by Karachi’s finest citizens to revisit the high court decision; or that the trial court deem the crime fasad-fil-arz, preventing pardon. ,Until then, we can only look at the abuse of the qisas/diyat laws, the soullessness of the Sindh government, and the compulsions of a justice system that has to apply terror provisions to block pardons, and scream reform. ,Because until we fix them forever, the Raymond rules will continue apace. “It didn’t seem possible,” Davis wrote of his release. For the briefest moment, it didn’t seem possible for Shahrukh Jatoi either. "

His wife, Sadaf, meanwhile said that they had torched the car only to frame it as an accident, but hadn't realised that the fire would be that massive. ,“Fahad did it [killed Naseer] in a fit of anger after seeing his mother’s pictures and videos. He had given up the company of his friends because of his mother’s character, as his friends used to say different things,"" his wife said.,She alleged that Naseer used to say that she was an independent person and would spend her life whatever way she deemed fit, which irked her son. ,""Fahad avoided [the situation] on many occasions, but for how long can it be avoided,"" she said."

,Initially reported as a robbery gone tragically awry, 16-year-old Aleena's murder caused a sensation when it emerged that her own sister, 20-year-old Alveena, had slit her throat allegedly after being subjected to sustained emotional abuse.,It emerged that the teenage victim and a male friend, identified as Ahsan, had been threatening Alveena that they would upload compromising pictures and videos of her on social media. Alveena , of not knowing what that would entail.,""I had no choice,"" she told the media.,The woman and her fiance admitted they had , to throw off the police.,			
,Violence against women takes many forms in Pakistan, but a series of attacks perpetrated by a mysterious knife-wielding motorcyclist (or motorcyclists) went into the realms of the unthinkable.,According to CCTV footage and victims' own accounts, the attacker would approach on a motorcycle and flee immediately after stabbing his victims. ,In a wave of attacks, at least 13 women of different age groups were stabbed on Karachi's streets, mostly in the Gulistan-i-Jauhar area of the city. ,While none of the attacks proved fatal, the repeated attacks nonetheless sparked widespread fear and panic in the city. Social media groups went wild trying to document the mystery attacker's most recent hits, and it soon became impossible to separate fact from fiction in the ensuing panic.,After investigating for almost three months, ,, or closed, due to lack of evidence. ,Despite reports of scores of suspects having been picked up by police, it remains unclear if the attacker is still at large.,			
,In April, ,, a student of Mass Communication at the Abdul Wali Khan University, Mardan, from his hostel room, subjected him to severe physical torture, and then shot him. ,Video footage of the incident, shared widely by shocked observers, showed Mashal lying on the floor, unmoving and covered in wounds as his fellow students cheered on his attackers.,Other recordings showed his killers calling him a blasphemer, exulting in his murder and vowing to protect each other from prosecution.,A 13-member joint investigation team, however, ,, who had been very vocal about the rights of students in the university, on the pretext of blasphemy and that there was no evidence that the victim had ever blasphemed.,Even the remotest criticism of how blasphemy laws are abused in Pakistan usually invites a severe reaction from right-wing forces. ,However, the numbing cruelty with which Mashal was murdered managed not only to briefly silence even the most rabid proponents of the laws, but also invited acknowledgements that ,. ,			
,Disappointingly, those promises — made in televised press conferences with Mashal's grieving father in tow — have yet to be delivered on, and with the government's ,, there is slim hope that full justice will ever be delivered for Mashal Khan. ,			
,Mohammad Safdar — federal lawmaker, Nawaz Sharif's son-in-law, Maryam Nawaz's husband and a retired army captain — chose the floor of the Assembly to ,, terming them ""a threat to the country, its Constitution and ideology"" while calling for a ban on the recruitment of Ahmadis in the armed forces, where many have served distinguished careers. ,His diatribe went on uninterrupted by the National Assembly Speaker for at least 10 minutes and ,.,Most of the PML-N leaders, including Nawaz Sharif and Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, made a show to ,, saying that the speech went against the ideology of the party; however, no punitive action has been taken against Safdar in this regard so far.,			
,On December 3, , near Karachi's Do Darya area in circumstances reminiscent of the ,.,Zafir and his friend Zaid had been on their way to breakfast at a local restaurant when they had a minor accident with a motorcycle.,Following the mishaps, five suspects travelling in a double-cabin vehicle chased them down. One of them opened indiscriminate fire. Zafir was killed; Zaid sustained bullet injuries.,The prime suspect in the case, Khawar Burney, remains in police custody. However, there is widespread concern that he may soon be allowed to walk free, as seems to have become the precedent in cases such as these.,The case has taken on even more significance since Shahrukh Jatoi and his two accomplices were allowed to walk on bail by the , and ordered a ,. These developments have come four years after Jatoi was awarded capital punishment and the case was considered to have been closed. ,Jatoi, despite having been a convicted murderer at the time, also ,, which raises the question: will Pakistan's powerful every pay?,			
,The PML-N dominated headlines throughout 2017, and mostly, it seems, for the wrong reasons.,One of the most shocking of the many stories that chased the beleaguered party involved a senator openly spewing vitriol and threatening the judges, investigators and their families involved in the Panamagate probe. ,The man in question, Nehal Hashmi, was seen in , lashing out at ""those investigating"" Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's family and warning that they would be ""taken to task"" for grilling the premier's family.,""Those grilling [the family] ... [be warned that] we will arrange the day of judgment for you."",""You are making the life of the prime minister difficult; the Pakistani nation will make it difficult for you to live,"" he had added. ,He was summarily ejected from the party.,Most disappointingly, Maryam Nawaz, the ousted prime minister's daughter, recently lent her support to ,, triggering debate that he may have had the Sharif family's blessings when he launched into his contemptuous tirade. ,			
,While the #MeToo campaign sparked an international movement against sexual harassment and abuse at the workplace many prominent cases of workplace harassment were reported in Pakistani media this year but sadly went largely ignored. ,Most recently, the elite Islamabad Club , after a female employee accused a ""powerful member"" of the club's management committee of sexually harassing her.,The employee alleged that she was fired immediately after she refused to obey ""immoral"" orders from the alleged harasser.,The allegation had prompted the federal government to form a committee to investigate the matter.,At the time, the committee had said it would compile its report within a month. However, there has been no news on the matter till the filing of this report. ,The Islamabad Club is known for secrecy and exclusivity. It is frequented by some of the most powerful people of the country. It is a depressing realisation that accountability may never be offered.,Yet another victim seems to have been silenced in similar circumstances. ,An investigation committee formed to probe , leveled by Syeda Sadia, a former goalkeeper for the women's national hockey team, against Saeed Khan, the team's head coach, has declared the former's claims ,The five-member committee's report, submitted recently to the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF), instead blames Sadia of alleging harassment ""because she had been recently dropped from the team."",It is worth pointing out that she does not seem to have been offered a fair probe. The committee that investigated her allegations included at least one person who had refused from the outset to place any faith in Sadia's statement, which raises the concern that the investigation may not have been impartial.,Then there were the ,, who claimed to have been harassed by party chief Imran Khan. The allegations were followed , directed against Gulalai online, with some even calling for an acid attack on the lawmaker for 'defaming' the PTI chief. ,			
,Gulalai has since been unwilling or unable to speak further on the matter, focusing instead on fighting off the ,. ,In circumstances like these, it was nothing short of a miracle that Pakistan Television , its director of current affairs, Agha Masood Shorish, following allegations of sexual harassment and misuse of authority by multiple staffers.,A total of five inquiries had been initiated against Shorish, including three for sexual harassment. PTV's 14 producers had also filed a complaint against him in the Islamabad High Court, and the issue had also been taken up in the National Assembly. ,But the victory did not come easy: the probe against Shorish was ,; he was sacked in November, and that too likely because his despicable actions had been highlighted relentlessly by one of his accusers, Tanzeela Mazhar, ,. ,In a stark example of politicians not putting their money where their mouth is, Nawaz Sharif — who has taken to presenting himself as a champion of the masses since his ouster — seems to have so far failed to atone for the death of a ,.,The child had been among a crowd of ardent supporters gathered to greet Nawaz Sharif as his motorcade passed through Lalamusa ,.,He was hit first by a car belonging to Elite Force personnel guarding a disqualified prime minister, before multiple following cars ran him over without stopping. He was killed on the spot.,Even though a fully-equipped mobile health unit had been accompanying Sharif's motorcade, bystanders said no car bothered to even slow down to take stock of the child's condition.,Nawaz later labelled the deceased boy as the first 'martyr' of his struggle for the strengthening of democracy, publicly promised to visit his home and condole with his parents, and also led a prayer for him.,He never made the promised visit.

619,2018-01-01,41 women killed for ‘honour’ in Gujrat in 2017,"GUJRAT: As many as 41 women were murdered on the pretext of ‘preserving honour’ and over domestic disputes in Gujrat during 2017. ,The number has increased from the previous year’s 35. In 2013, around 51 women were murdered followed by 36 in 2014. ,According to data collected from the district police office, most of the women had been slain by their kin and the complainants in these cases were also family members. However, there was no conviction in these cases as the complainants would reconcile with the suspects. ,Most of these murders occurred in rural areas in the jurisdictions of Jalalpur Jattan Saddar, Kunjah, Daulat Nagar and Dinga police stations. The police stations in recently urbanised areas located in the outskirts of the city also reported an alarming number of cases of violence against women. Three women of a family were killed for ‘honour’ in the Civil Lines police precincts besides a few others over the year. ,There were 38 cases of women’s murders reported to various police stations in 2017 as compared to 34 in 2016. Some unidentified bodies were also recovered during the last year who did not belong to Gujrat district, including the recently solved blind murder of a woman who belonged to Rawalpindi.  ,Women were also killed over marriage disputes, domestic issues and various other reasons. A senior police investigation officer told Dawn that he believed culture and traditions were the main reason behind violence against women. He stressed effective legislation and awareness campaigns to contain such violence. ,He added that out of the 38 registered cases, suspects nominated in 36 had been arrested and sent behind bars, but such suspects would often be released on technical grounds mainly due to pardoning by and reconciliation with complainants, who were mostly the victim’s relatives.,Prof Dr Muhammad Nizamuddin, chairman of the Punjab Higher Education Commission, says Pakistan had high prevalence of violence against women owing to various factors such as a patriarchal society where gender inequality at various levels was accepted as a norm. Men had assumed higher status in society irrespective of caste, creed, finance and education, he stressed.,“Pakistani society is complex with various ethnic groups, but when it comes to gender inequality almost all groups, classes and sects seem to follow this rule -- although intensity varies. Men are taught that they are superior, and the structure of society has been evolved and developed to give men more power. This unequal power lies at the root of violence against women,” he explained."

622,2018-01-01,Police suspect ‘political motive’ for knife attacks on women in Karachi,"KARACHI: A top police officer on Sunday hinted that the recent knife attacks on several women, particularly in the Gulistan-i-Jauhar and Gulshan-i-Iqbal areas, might have been carried out by elements pursuing their own political agenda. ,Additional Inspector General of Karachi Mushtaq Ahmed Mahar in his brief talk with Dawn said that “a political agenda behind the knife attacks on women was one of the possibilities being probed by investigators.” ,The city police chief added that the police investigators had got “significant clues” to the identity of the culprits involved in these attacks. ,Mr Mahar said efforts were under way to arrest the suspects who might have “fled to other parts of the country or abroad to avoid arrest”. ,The senior officer added that the police would be in a better position to say anything for sure about the actual motive for the culprits when they would be arrested and properly investigated. ,Almost two dozen knife attacks on women had taken place mostly in District East’s five police stations jurisdictions — Sharea Faisal, Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Gulshan-i-Iqbal, Aziz Bhatti and PIB Colony. ,Two more knife attacks on girls had taken place in Federal B Area of the central district and Saudabad locality of Korangi district, but the police investigators familiar with these attacks on Sunday told Dawn that they were not linked with the knife attacks on women in Gulistan-i-Jauhar and Gulshan-i-Iqbal. ,These knife attacks on women belonging to different backgrounds and age groups took place between September and October of 2017, which triggered fear and panic among residents, putting a question mark over the performance of law enforcers and effectiveness of the ongoing targeted operation in the metropolis. ,The police authorities set up different investigation teams belonging to various specialised units, who were also assisted by intelligence agencies, to capture the culprits. ,Dawn on Sunday talked to three senior police officers associated with the investigation of the knife attacks and all preferred not to be named. ,The police officers revealed that one team of investigators had detained three suspects while another team detained the fourth suspect. ,These arrests were made in Gulistan-i-Jauhar of District East and parts of District Central. ,During interrogations, the held suspects provided important clues to the police about the possible identity and motive of the culprits. ,All the four suspects told the same story to investigators. ,They revealed that ‘political elements’ were involved in those knife attacks. ,Regarding the motive for the attacks, the held suspects stated that some political elements wanted to revive the street ‘barrier system’ in the city, which was dismantled after the launch of Rangers-led targeted operation in 2013. ,The police sources said that the held suspects also disclosed that the political elements wanted to ‘activate the unit system’ after ‘revival’ of the barriers. ,However, a senior police officer familiar with those arrests told Dawn on condition of anonymity that all the four detained suspects were not “proper party workers”. ,They had been associated with the party in the past, but subsequently, they joined the world of crimes, added the officer. ,The officer recalled that following the knife attacks on women, a move was started by political elements to initiate a debate for reinstalling barriers on roads in the metropolis. ,“Honestly speaking, it is yet to be established with a degree of certainty that whether political elements were behind the knife attacks on women or just that they wanted to take undue advantage of this situation for the revival of the barrier system,” said the officer. ,The police officer said that as part of putting pressure on political elements, the district east police had also detained 50 political workers for interrogation who were subsequently released as knife attacks on women were ‘spoiling’ the gains made through the targeted operation. ,Earlier in his interview with a TV channel reporter, additional IG of Karachi Mushtaq Mahar pointed out that “three to four suspects” were involved in the series of knife attacks. And that there was a “political agenda” behind those attacks, said the city police chief without elaborating. ,Also without naming anyone, he said the police played a vital role in ending those knife attacks on women by sending a ‘strong message’ to those involved in that crime.

Moreover, controlling street crimes also required standardised number-plates in vehicles and installation of trackers, especifically in motorbikes. ,Another issue which police faced in curbing street crimes was traffic jams partly caused by the ongoing development works. ,Mr Mahar said they had brought the matter before the concerned authorities that either the development work should be completed at the earliest, or it be carried out at night to avoid traffic jams. ,The city police chief believed that most of the street crimes were carried out during traffic jams between 5pm to 11pm, mostly by people living in adjoining slum areas. ,He said police was facing shortage of resources as several areas/spots had been identified for installation of CCTVs recently but the police, so far, could install only two CCTVs one at the Submarine roundabout in Punjab Colony and the other at Tipu Sultan Road that too, with the assistance of the citizens. ,Besides, 22 CCTVs had been put in place by Ismailis, Bohras and businessmen as part of their neighbourhood watch, hence lowering the crime there. ,Mushtaq Mahar said that there was also the manpower scarcity besides the resource shortage. ,Recalling security cover to polio workers every month, he said that around 8000 to 9000 security personnel carried out their duties to provide protection to polio workers. Besides, as many as 17 mega events were handled and peacefully guarded by police round the year. ,CPLC Chief Zubair Habib had also observed a downward trend in all major crimes except theft of motorbikes. He said that the issue had been taken up in the Apex Committee meeting. Subsequently, three meetings were held by the home minister with all stakeholders present, including the CPLC. ,It was also decided in principle that legislation would be introduced to make installation of trackers in motorbikes as ‘mandatory’ and registration of bikes won’t be done without it. Besides, number plates would also be installed on the front of the two-wheelers."

653,2018-01-07,FOOTPRINTS: CREATING CHILD-FRIENDLY COURTS,"			
,AT the heart of Punjab’s capital, a narrow lane stemming from the populous Lower Mall Road leads to a civil courthouse. The dilapidated building, with paint flaking off its walls, is swamped with men in black blazers who immediately take notice of a woman entering the premises. ,The attorneys and their clients — all male — occupy corners of the building absorbed in conversation; their tones loud and aggressive as they prepare for another day of bail applications, appeals, petitions and delays. The security guard is fast asleep across the courtroom, his head resting against a wall inscribed with the words: “To Each His Own”. ,Towers of folders spill into dusty corridors where passers-by squeeze sideways, making their way through stacks of case papers, stepping over recently placed campaign posters, now lying on the floor. ,But things are different on the first floor. A hallway leads into a bright blue and yellow-painted corridor with paintings hung along the passage marking the entrance to the country’s first juvenile court.,The Juvenile Justice System Ordinance 2000 (JJSO) is the primary law underlying the conduct of juvenile justice in Pakistan which delineates separate and strengthened safeguards for juveniles below the age of 18 involved in criminal litigation with an aim to rehabilitate and reintegrate them back into society.,As per law, this first-of-its-kind special court will only cater to cases involving children under the age of 18 years, either as the accused, victims or witnesses. The recently-inaugurated court has two halls — a waiting area filled with toys, and a separate room where under-trial children will be counselled by a psychiatrist to minimise the traumatic deposition of facing a trial. ,A psychiatrist will work here with a probation officer to offer counselling during trial, and focus on the psychoanalysis of accused children and come up with recommendations for judges to minimise the imprint of criminal activity on a culprit’s cognition.,An open-air corridor outside the courtroom is lined with white boards — placed there for children to express their feelings on while they await their turn for court proceedings. It is hoped that this will not only help children relieve stress, but also help the psychiatrist evaluate their mental state, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Akhtar Bhangoo, the child court judge, tells Dawn. ,“This visionary step will provide a protective, confidence-inspiring atmosphere even for children as victims or witnesses,” he says, adding that the impact of colours on emotions, and books and toys was specifically taken into consideration in order to make the court child-friendly.,Another salient feature of the special court, says Mr Bhangoo, is a video-statement facility. In accordance with the JJSO, no direct contact of the child victim or witness is permitted during court proceedings. ,“The child’s statement will be recorded via video link from the waiting area which will protect him from speaking under pressure in the presence of his offender in the courtroom,” the judge says, while pointing out that the law did not allow a juvenile case to be tried jointly with an adult. “The child court will take one case at a time and will try to finalise it as soon as possible,” he asserts.,Initially, 80 cases involving children have been transferred to the new court, with the first being registered a few days ago.,According to Barrister Umer Riaz Sheikh, even though children’s rights have been set out in the federally-applicable JJSO and other child protection laws, the juvenile justice system in Pakistan lacks implementation.,He tells Dawn that under the JJSO, children who came into conflict with the law should not be handcuffed, given corporal punishment, made to do labour or awarded the death sentence (Section 12). “The law states that legal and medical aid should be granted to a child under trial by the state and his identity should be protected,” he adds. ,Based on Unicef estimates, almost 89 per cent of children charged with bailable offences are kept in prison primarily because of their inability to afford a lawyer. Lack of legal aid also means that juveniles are less likely to raise juvenility pleas during investigation and trial, and therefore, fall outside the ambit of the JJSO.,The Justice Project Pakistan (JPP) in collaboration with Yale Law School and the Allard K Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic discovered 58 cases of torture of juveniles out of a sample of 1,867 medico-legal certificates.,Moreover, a report titled ‘Death Row’s Children — Pakistan’s Unlawful Executions of Juvenile Offenders’, prepared by the NGO, revealed that at least 10pc of the current death-row population comprised of 800 juvenile offenders. “According to Section 14 of the JJSO, the law does not repeal other laws but applies ‘in addition’ to them. To ensure that children aged below 18 years are not executed, the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 needs to be amended so that it cannot override the juvenile law,” says Advocate Obaidullah. ,After almost 18 years following the promulgation of the JJSO, and only one juvenile court being set up so far, it is apparent that the legal provisions are yet to be fully implemented. The dignity of a child needs to be the first and foremost priority here, be it through the implementation of domestic or international laws."

676,2018-01-10,Shahzeb Khan's murder was shocking but was it 'terrorism'?,"All murders are gruesome but some are so depraved that they compel people to speak out against injustice and skewed criminal justice systems that seem to absolve the rich and indict the poor.,This was the case with Shahrukh Jatoi’s murder of Shahzeb Khan on Christmas day in 2012. It rallied people together, particularly the youth, who demanded that Jatoi be punished.,The following year, an Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) , Jatoi and one of his accomplices to death and  sentenced two others involved in the murder to life imprisonment.,The case, however, came back to light when a criminal review application was , by Jatoi’s lawyer in August, 2016.,This past November, the Sindh High Court (SHC) revoked the sentences and , a retrial to be carried out in a regular court.     ,Jatoi’s counsel had argued that their client was a juvenile at the time of murder and should not have been tried by an ATC. They also added that the murder was a result of personal enmity, which is different from terrorism.  ,In response to the SHC decision, a citizen's petition was filed at the start of this year in the Supreme Court, demanding that Jatoi’s conviction by the ATC stands valid.  ,The petition, supported by several well-known citizens, refers to the legal definition of terrorism in the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1997, whereby:,“‘Terrorism’ means the use or threat of action where … The use or threat is designed to coerce and intimidate or overawe the Government or the public or a section of the public or community or sect or create a sense of fear or insecurity in society…”,This definition of terrorism includes ordinary urban crimes as long as the claim can be supported that the crime in question struck terror, panic and fear among people in a section of society.,Unfortunately, the petition is misplaced as it relies on an overbroad and vague definition of terrorism – a definition which is need of revision.  ,While securing the conviction of a known murderer is a good aim, especially when the defendant is powerful and can influence the lower courts, the arguments in the petition give rise to several issues that need to be addressed.,: what is terrorism?,What we understand by ‘terrorism’ should be restricted to groups like the TTP, LeJ, JuD, JUA, ISIS and other similar outfits who have caused widespread mayhem in the country.,They have indiscriminately bombed minority places of worship and public areas; killed students; carried out calculated murders of members of various minority communities; and waged a war against the state and society.,Their motive is to exert control and dominion through terror.,Which leads to the , question: was Shahzeb’s murder an act of terror?,The murder was dreadful, the consequences were tragic, and the victim’s family deserves unlimited support and compassion.,Having said that, the murder should not qualify as terrorism even if elements of power, aggression, and deliberate intimidation were part of it.,This is because the murder doesn’t compare to the acts of the above-mentioned groups in terms of ideological motivations and political goals, which are sustained through funding, organising and sheer application.,: is there a difference between motive and ,?,Motive for murder is not the same as , for murder. The former constitutes reasons for the act; these could be personal, revenge, provocation, aggression, or show of power.,The latter is the fault element in killing and is satisfied as long as Jatoi used his weapon to kill intentionally.,A motive to spread terror, versus the impact of it as causing the same, is a different thing altogether and should not be confused with ,.,: there is a misconception that Jatoi has been acquitted or a coerced settlement has been permitted by the court – and that he has , evaded justice.,The case will be retried in an ordinary sessions court. This means that Jatoi and his co-accused will have a second shot at justice; it does not, however, mean that he is, or will be, automatically absolved of his crime.,: what are the real legal injustices at play that privilege the rich over the poor in criminal cases? Coercion of poor families to forgive the killers who are rich – isn’t that the real issue?,Since Qisas and Diyat laws allow convicted murderers to be forgiven by victims’ families (which is not a provision in ATCs) the very idea of a new trial invokes the fear that Jatoi’s powerful family will coerce a settlement from Shahzeb’s family (which they have already tried to do) or that the judge will acquit.,Considering the indisputable evidence in the case, an acquittal is unlikely but a settlement is quite likely.,Settlements under Qisas and Diyat should therefore be the battleground for activists and progressive lawyers, rather than fighting for the implementation of an expansive interpretation of ‘terrorism.’,At the same time, it should be kept in mind that an outcry against private settlements is not possible. To oppose Qisas and Diyat would be to oppose laws that carry the hue of Sharia and are enacted, ostensibly, to make our laws more compliant with an elusive Islamic ideal.,Nonetheless, legal mechanisms are still available to prevent these settlements. Courts can disallow private settlements in murder cases where there are aggravating circumstances.,According to Section 311 of the Pakistan Penal Code, if the murder is shocking or if it outrages the public conscience, then the court, in its wisdom, may forbid any forgiveness or a payout, and send the defendant to jail.,This is important since the wholesale privatisation of justice where victims’ families can forgive murderers weakens the writ of the state.,It constricts the judiciary’s power and provides a legal stamp of approval to the rich and the powerful paying their way out of crime.,			
,Shahzeb’s murder was shocking and Jatoi deserves punishment. However, it was not a case of terrorism.,The argument that cases like these should be heard in an ATC is based on a faulty logic. If so, every case of murder will have to be referred to an ATC. ,By extension, the existing definition of terrorism also needs to be changed so as to focus on recognised terror outfits and not run-of-the-mill crimes.,Existing laws allow regular courts to deny a private settlement and issue a fair sentence. Our efforts, therefore, should be on these courts to make sure they uphold justice."

It also said a house-to-house search was being conducted based on the information provided by the last witness of the crime. ,It said that a case had separately been registered regarding the incident of firing on people protesting Zainab's murder. Sections 302 and 201 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), which deal with wilful murder and wiping out evidence, have been included in the first information report (FIR) of the incident, the report said.,A post-mortem examination of the victim, who went missing on Jan 4 and was found dead in a trash heap by police on Jan 9, suggested she was raped and strangled to death. DNA samples collected from her body have been sent to a lab in Lahore for forensic testing ─ a process that can take up to three months.,The victim's family yesterday accused the police of being un-cooperative when they were alerted that Zainab had gone missing. ,Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah told , earlier today that the joint investigation team tasked to investigate the murder has been in touch with the family and will work closely with them to solve the case.,He added that at least four people have been taken into custody for ""investigation purposes"", but no formal arrests had been made in the case as yet. ""We are hopeful that the culprit will be caught very soon,"" the minister said.,The brutal murder of the girl is the 12th such case to occur within a two-kilometre radius in the city over the last year. ,The surfacing of a series of similar cases since 2015 have led police to believe that a 'serial killer' is behind the horrific rapes and murders of minors in Kasur.,An initial probe indicates that a 'serial killer' was behind all eight cases reported in the district since 2015. ,A rudimentary sketch of the suspect had been prepared by police in 2015 with the help of a local who spotted him as he was going to assault a minor girl in an under-construction house. ,A police official told , that more incidents of abduction of children, including five girls, occurred in Kasur district ─ all of which were reported within the jurisdiction of three police stations  – A Division, B Division and Sadar.,Three out of the eight cases, including the latest one, occurred recently. ,The official said a team of senior police officers had last year attempted a detailed analysis of all the cases in the light of circumstantial evidences, DNA test reports, statements of the two girls who survived the assaults, the witnesses and other relevant information.,			
,The efforts were prompted in July 2017 when a case similar to Zainab's surfaced. ,The officers had concluded that a single person was behind all the cases surfacing in the district.,The view was strengthened when the investigators found a close resemblance between the man in the CCTV footage of Zainab and the culprit’s sketch in the police record.,""We had started the hunt for the serial killer shortly after the first case in 2015,"" the police official said.,""We had got reports of five DNA samples sent to the lab for analysis and the reports showed they belonged to the same person,"" the police official said.,[A reward of Rs10 million][4] has been announced by the Punjab government for anyone who can identify Zainab's killer."
691,2018-01-12,Activists vow to spread awareness in children as city mourns Zainab’s murder,"KARACHI: As Karachi united in protests demanding justice for Zainab on Thursday, NGOs, activists, women’s rights groups and members of civil society joined hands to also raise their voices about awareness programmes for children. ,At a press conference at the Karachi Press Club, founder and president Zindagi Trust Shehzad Roy with representatives of Aahung made an earnest appeal to introduce such programmes in primary schools across Pakistan. ,“I am also a father. Thinking of that innocent child fills my eyes with tears. But I also know that this happens to one in every five children in my country and even after punishing the person responsible for such a heinous act, this kind of thing will not end,” he said. ,Joined by Karamat Ali of Piler, civil liberty activist and lawyer Gibran Nasir, actors Mahira Khan, Sanam Saeed, Hina Khwaja Bayat and founder of the Citizens-Police Liaison Committee Nazim Haji, the National Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime said that it was a well-known fact that when it comes to molesting or raping of children only 10 per cent of the people engaging in such ugly acts are outsiders. There is a CCTV footage of Zainab walking with a man holding her hand. “Ninety per cent of the people who engage in such crimes are familiar faces who the child knows,” he pointed out. ,‘When a child reports anything out of the ordinary to the parents, they make him or her shut up’,“But when a child reports anything out of the ordinary to the parents, they make him or her shut up. They are not allowed to say such things about their uncles or aunts. There is no one who believes them,” he said. “And this has an even worse effect on his or her psyche. They are like the walking dead.”,He explained that awhile back the organisation Aahung took it upon itself to take social awareness programmes for children to government schools, but it was stopped by a particular lobby, which mislabelled it as ‘sex education’. “There is a lobby here which says that we are trying to push forth foreign agenda,” said Roy. ,“But we should understand this that if you don’t talk to your children and explain to them things such as good touch and bad touch, they are at risk of getting molested which can also lead to rape,” he said. ,“The issue won’t be resolved by just punishing the person who did this. Parents have to talk to their children about these things. They should not discourage the child from coming to them to talk about something that makes them feel uncomfortable with anyone. They should not make them feel ashamed,” he said. ,“We want to change the debate. We want to make awareness education part of the school curriculum,” he said. ,Actor Sanam Saeed also suggested the preparing of short videos as public service messages to spread awareness. ,Nazo Pirzada of Aahung said they had a range of thoughtfully designed placards and cartoons for children as young as three years of age. ,Gibran Nasir said they had been watching television anchors screaming themselves hoarse about punishing the culprit. “But we should realise that we will be like helping hands of molesters and rapists for fighting the inclusion of social awareness education in schools,” he said. ,It was said that Zainab’s was the 12th such case in Kasur, which followed only two years after the largest child pornography ring, including 300 children and their families, uncovered in the same area.,During a meet the press programme, Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians Secretary for Information and member of the National Assembly Dr Nafisa Shah, too, condemned the heartless rape, torture and murder of little Zainab. ,Outside the KPC the ‘Justice for Zainab’ slogan and banners were raised the entire day.

She said this incident had woken us to ponder how to check such beasts. ,Shamim Mumtaz, Adviser on Social Welfare, said no doubt such incidents also occurred in other parts of the country, but it was horrified to see that in Punjab the incidents of stripping women and parading them in streets, killing of babies after raping them, and blackmailing the families and children after making their objectionable videos were taking place frequently. ,Naheed Begum of the MQM said 11 such incidents had occurred in Kasur in the past few months.

I need support and guidance from all quarters to educate the society against this kind of terrorism,” he added."

696,2018-01-12,Monsters amongst us,"KASUR is once again the scene of a depraved crime against a child. The , is a grotesque illustration of the state’s increasing disconnect with the people. ,The little girl went missing last Thursday, abducted while on her way to a religious tuition centre; her brutalised body was found on Wednesday, discarded on a heap of garbage. ,In 2015, , that had been preying for years on several minors in Kasur district, making videos in which the victims were coerced into performing sex acts. ,Despite the outrage triggered by that case, the criminal justice system remains as dysfunctional as ever. For Zainab’s abduction and rape is reportedly preceded by no less than 12 similar cases — still unsolved — within a two-kilometre radius in Kasur city during the past two years. ,But this time, public anger spilled over on the streets of Punjab with riots continuing into the second day. Police firing into the crowd of protesters left two people dead. ,No matter which society, crimes against children evoke an especially acute horror. In Pakistan, that initial revulsion comes up against a state callously indifferent to its duty to protect citizens, even the younger segment of the population. ,Criminal investigations are not of a standard that can lead to prosecutions; traumatised child victims are not handled with sensitivity by the police, nor does the latter liaise with organisations trained in rape counselling who can help these minors deal with their ordeal. ,Law enforcement’s lackadaisical attitude, which is of course generally applicable to crimes across the board — is born out of the knowledge that there will be absolutely no repercussions for their failure to properly compile and analyse evidence, an approach that takes time and discipline. ,After the child porn ring was unearthed in Kasur, years after it had claimed its first victims, one would have imagined that the police would have expended every effort to track down the individuals responsible for the rape and abduction, and in some cases murder, of so many other girls in the same area. ,Meanwhile, as seen time and again, brute force is often the tactic of choice to deal with public protests. ,Again, it is the easy way out. Endemic abuse of power and lack of justice have left society seething with pent-up frustration, an impotent rage that spills over into mob violence as witnessed over the last two days. ,While such mayhem cannot be condoned, it arises from very legitimate, yet unmet, expectations. ,The criminal justice system must be overhauled and reformed to serve the people. Underscoring the scale of the problem, the bodies of two more child rape victims surfaced yesterday in parts of Punjab other than Kasur. ,The paedophiles that live amongst us should no longer be able to freely walk the streets."

712,2018-01-13,Return to Kasur,"			
,EARLIER this week, the body of a six-year-old girl was recovered from a garbage heap in Kasur. It has since been confirmed that she was raped and murdered. Kasur has erupted in riots. The autopsy report is unreadable.,In moments of human horror, we turn to the facts. And the facts tell us that Zainab’s case isn’t a onetime tragedy, but a recurring national nightmare, one we could have woken up from three years ago. ,In 2015, as everyone knows, the same Kasur saw a child sex abuse scandal of staggering proportions: reports of hundreds of victims and hundreds of video clips. When the details bled into the headlines — spinal injections, sodomy, a network of paedophiles filming the abuse — there was outrage.,But the state took the same road it had taken before, and would soon take again. Kasur flared up in protest, as it did now. A police officer was suspended, as he was now. The chief minister of Punjab took strict notice, as he did now. And his office threw together an inquiry committee, as it did now. ,It would seem there are only two modes of operation in Kasur: slumber and sadism.,Only in 2015, the committee said “no instance” of child sex abuse had been reported — per the Punjab government, the issue at hand was a land dispute. ,This ran contrary to the findings of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, which found that a large number of children had not only been abused, the police may have intimidated the victims when the scandal became public. It also ran contrary to the findings of the National Commission on Human Rights, which noted that DNA reports were pending for two years. Indeed, the Punjab government’s take even ran contrary to the Punjab government: the head of the Child Protection & Welfare Bureau called it “the largest-ever child abuse scandal in Pakistan’s history”. Yet for such a massive scandal, victims were calling for justice outside the Lahore Press Club as late as last December.,Which brings us to Zainab and the present: as riots grip Kasur by day, the chief minister has visited the parents in the dead of night, promising them the same justice. But though we stand here yet again, the conversation we’re having is all wrong.,First, what happened to Zainab wasn’t some undetected evil: it’s the 12th case to occur over the past two years within a two-kilometre radius. There also came the stunning revelation, via Kasur’s regional police officer, that the DNA in five of the city’s sexual abuse cases was the same, pointing to the same perpetrators. ,Second, one particularly privileged segment — from coddled aunties to elected representatives — see fit to blame the parents. They should try facing working-class Pakistanis that have no choice but to leave their kids at the mercy of the society we’ve created for them. ,Third, when the state refuses to diagnose the disease — ie pegging a ring of child pornographers to a land dispute — it not only fosters a culture of impunity, it also knocks dead any momentum for investigation. As the HRCP’s report notes, “In the presence of clear and convincing evidence that a heinous crime […] has occurred, the issue of the land becomes irrelevant in the context of the duty of the state to investigate and to take all necessary measures to protect these children.”,Fourth, at a time when the Model Town massacre’s shadow has never loomed larger, the Punjab Police has opened fire on protesters yet again, killing two. It would seem there’s only two modes of operation in Kasur: slumber and sadism. The Punjab government should realise that just because it has a hammer, not every problem is a nail. ,Fifth, the centre has made much about playing politics over tragedy. For once, it is right — to the extent of the opposition breathing fire without really touching on the real social issue at stake: that our children are vulnerable. For all else though, this argument is weightless. If indeed child abuse is a ‘structural problem’, then by dint of being in power in Punjab for the better part of 30 years, it’s the PML-N that should have dented the said structural problem by now. ,Because if everyone is responsible, no one is responsible: the same has held true for much of our history. Men in this country take pleasure in sneering about sexual assault; that shouldn’t excuse Gen Musharraf from linking rape to Canadian visa scams. States have been known to use sexual violence to silence their enemies; that can never absolve Jam Sadiq’s CIA from brutalising women in Sindh. Rape is notoriously difficult to investigate the world over, yet hard stats tell us the Hudood laws jailed victims for adultery instead, many of whom were later molested in prison.  ,The buck doesn’t stop with dead committees and deposed district police officers. It’s been nine years since the chief minister assumed power, and two since his province saw the biggest child abuse scandal in our history. At this rate, the Shahbaz era won’t be remembered for some tired Mussolini metric; that the trains ran on time. It will be remembered for what it meant for Punjab’s children. Sans any real reforms, we can only pray his third chance is better than his second. ,Finally, it’s time we realise society requires overhauling as much as the state does. Children are not usually molested by the stranger hiding in the weeds, but by family or friends. Sanctity of the child must come before warped views of honour, and it is heartening to see taboo subjects being brought into the light by conscientious citizens. ,Parliament too has since amended the Pakistan Penal Code to include child pornography and sexual assault against minors, but the road ahead is long. Section 3 of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance 2000, providing free legal assistance to child victims, has yet to be implemented. Child-friendly courts and protection centres also have yet to exist, and self-protection in our curricula has yet to catch on. But now is the chance.,It is easier to build strong children, the saying goes, than repair broken men. For the sake of Zainab’s family and so many like hers, we would do best to heed those words. "

There was no one else at the crime scene who might have been terrorised by [the murder]"", Khosa argued. ,He said the fight between Shahrukh and Shahzeb had started with a slap and ended with a gunshot, adding that since the victim was the brother of the girl being harassed by Shahrukh's accomplices, he managed to gather the public's sympathy. ,Khosa further said that none of the witnesses of the case believed it to have been an act of terrorism.,The prosecution lawyer Faisal Siddiqui, however, insisted that if Shahzeb's murder would not have been an act of terrorism, the civil society would not have filed a petition to challenge the SHC's decision.,Siddiqui went on to argue that the SHC had overlooked important legal aspects of the case. He also reminded the court that the SC had not objected when the case's challan was first submitted in the SC — after then chief justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry had taken suo motu notice of the case in 2012 — even though it had included terrorism clauses.,Siddiqui argued that Shahzeb's murder had a wide impact and had sparked nationwide protests, and should, therefore, qualify as an act of terrorism. The CJP, however, took this argument with a grain of salt, saying that the court will make a decision in accordance with the law instead of relying on public opinion and protests. ,In November, 2017, the SHC had set aside the death penalty awarded to the convicts in the Shahzeb murder case and ordered a retrial after Shahrukh Jatoi's lawyer, Advocate Farooq H. Naek, successfully argued that terrorism charges should not have been included in the case.,Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Mian Saqib Nisar has ordered that the convicts appear in court for the next hearing of the case, but adjourned the hearing indefinitely.,On the night of December 24, 2012, 20-year-old Shahzeb Khan, the son of Deputy Superintendent of Police Aurangzeb Khan, had been gunned down in Karachi's Defence Housing Authority.

733,2018-01-17,Rights activists ask CJP to take notice of Prof Arif’s ‘murder’,"KARACHI: While rights activists, teachers and students called the death of Prof Dr Hasan Zafar Arif a “murder” and asked the chief justice of Pakistan on Tuesday to take notice of it, police investigators remained clueless about the mystery that shrouded the death of the Harvard-educated man, who was also a main leader of the Altaf Hussain-led Muttahida Qaumi Movement-London.,On Jan 14, the body of Prof Arif, 75, was found in the rear seat of his car in Ilyas Goth, near the seashore in the Ibrahim Hyderi area.,Apart from leaders of the different factions of the MQM which expressed their shock over his mysterious “death”, Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutt-Zardari tweeted that he was “deeply disturbed by the murder” of Prof Arif and “there needs to be a complete investigation”.,Soon after his tweet, the Sindh government appointed DIG-East Sultan Ali Khowaja as inquiry officer to conduct a probe into Prof Arif’s death.,DIG Khowaja said on Tuesday that he was waiting for the chemical examiner’s report to reach any conclusion about the mystery behind Prof Arif’s death, saying the medico-legal reports of the autopsy suggested that it was a natural death.,Police insist the MQM-London leader died of natural causes,But rights activists, teachers and students did not believe that Prof Arif died of natural causes. They gathered outside the Karachi Press Club on Tuesday and staged a demonstration against his “murder”, terming it the murder of humanity.,The protesters were holding up placards and banners inscribed with slogans demanding ‘justice’ for the late philosopher.,Before the protest, Asad Iqbal Butt of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and other activists said at a press conference that the truth was being hidden in the autopsy report as Prof Arif was tortured.,Demanding an investigation so that facts came into light, Mr Butt requested the chief justice of Pakistan to take cognizance of the incident and bring those involved to justice.,He said Prof Arif was a political activist and a revered professor of Karachi University who commanded respect of friends and foes alike despite having ideological differences.,He said he was the first Karachi coordinator of the HRCP during former military dictator Gen Ziaul Haq’s regime.,Mr Butt said the late professor was an agitator to the core who lost his job in KU soon after he was elected president of the Karachi University Teachers Society because he vocally opposed Zia’s military regime.,“And,” he added, “Dr Arif was arrested merely for listening to a hateful speech in October 2016 and not making one himself.”,He said in the past few months a trend to target the dissenting voices was on the rise in which activists, students and others were being targeted.,He said enforced disappearances were immensely damaging the very fabric of society that could even lead to its disintegration. “This atmosphere of fear and terror should end.”,Classical dancer and activist Sheema Kirmani said she was disappointed that the culture of dissent was being murdered when people having diverse views deviating from the ‘acceptable narrative’ were being ‘targeted and eliminated’.,However, the police authorities apparently so far have been ruling out all possibilities of his murder and came up with different arguments to prove their points.,“Currently, nothing emerged conclusive which can suggest anything about his unnatural death,” DIG Khowaja told reporters at his office. “Prof Arif’s body was found in his own car. His family said that he didn’t return home a night before his death but strangely he was not reported missing by them. The autopsy report did not show any sign of torture or signs of unnatural death.”,The DIG said that his car was also examined and “nothing was found during that examination which can lead us to any suspicion”. ,He said all his belongings, including medicines, Rs17,350 and a bottle of water, were intact in the car. ,However, there was no answer that how Prof Arif reached a desolated coastal neighbourhood instead of his Defence residence and that how his body was found in the rear seat.,But the DIG lamented that after the incident “a propaganda campaign was launched on social media with different pictures of Prof Arif which were taken after the autopsy”. ,“During that medical process [autopsy], multiple wounds appear on the body which were shown on social media as marks of torture.”,Prof Arif was in Oct 2016 taken into custody by Rangers personnel from outside the KPC, where he was due to address a press conference with other leaders of the MQM-London. He was booked for allegedly facilitating and listening to a controversial speech of MQM founder Altaf Hussain. In April 2017, he was released from the Karachi central prison after an antiterrorism court issued his release order."

738,2018-01-17,Solving Zainab’s murder,"THE horrific rape-murder of little Zainab continues to be front and centre in the public consciousness. ,Following days of protests in several parts of the country triggered by the discovery of her brutalised body, the demand for her killer to be identified and brought to justice quickly remains as strong as ever. ,The evidence so far, according to the police, indicates that Zainab is the latest victim of a serial killer. Another piece of important evidence is CCTV footage, of which three clips have been aired in the media. ,The first and second videos, both released by police, show the little girl in the company of the apparent killer, in one of them being led by the hand, and another in which she is walking alongside him. ,The third video, which surfaced on social media on Saturday, showed a lone man, the purported murderer, strolling by himself down a street. ,This last video, which has evidently been leaked to the media could, according to area people, create confusion because the individual in it looks different from the earlier clips; moreover, the location is far from Zainab’s home. ,The widespread anguish over the as yet unsolved murder is very understandable. ,However, it seems the police, in response to the justified furore over its failure to investigate earlier similar cases in the same area, has gone into overdrive in an effort to appear proactive. ,Such a diametrically opposite approach to its earlier, inexcusable apathy is not necessarily desirable. To carry out a sound investigation that builds a prosecutable case, a methodical, dispassionate modus operandi — rather than one propelled by public sentiment — is essential. ,Various political parties and pressure groups are also playing their role in stoking the vigilante-like atmosphere by co-opting the ‘justice for Zainab’ rallying cry and exploiting the tragedy for political gain. ,The child’s murder was heinous; the killer must be apprehended; and police protocols reformed — not because the public demands it but because that is the right and just thing to do."

I don’t think I need to point out how disrespectful this is towards his memory and his family”.,The mysterious death of Prof Arif — the main leader of Altaf Hussain-led Muttahida Qaumi Movement-London in Pakistan, who was found dead in the rear seat of his car in a coastal suburban village in Ibrahim Haideri on Sunday — triggered widespread speculations. ,Apart from leaders of the different MQM factions which expressed their shock over his mysterious death, Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari tweeted that he was “deeply disturbed by the murder” of Prof Arif and “there needs to be a complete investigation”.,The Sindh government appointed DIG-East Sultan Ali Khowaja as an inquiry officer to conduct a probe into Prof Arif’s death. After three days of the initial probe, DIG Khowaja had said that he was waiting for the chemical examiner’s report to reach any conclusion about the mystery behind Prof Arif’s death, saying the medico-legal report suggested that it was a natural death. ,But rights activists, teachers and students did not believe that Prof Arif died of natural causes. They had gathered outside the Karachi Press Club on Tuesday and staged a demonstration against his “murder”, terming it the murder of humanity.,Prof Arif’s daughter, however, tried to remove all doubts and believed that a heart attack was the reason for her father’s passing. While conceding that her father went “missing” for one night, she said that the desolate place where the body was found had been frequented by him. ,“The circumstances under which he was found are not as dramatic or suspicious,” she said. “...he was missing for one night, his car was found in an area he was known to frequent, and his mobile phones were likely stolen through the rolled down windows of the car by members of the general public who were on the scene when the police arrived. The post-mortem report is not yet out, we are waiting on it, and until then, we have no real reason to believe it was anything but a heart attack.”,She criticised the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre’s staff and police for leaving the body outside in an open ambulance.,“Unless the post-mortem report says otherwise, we must believe, based on all the evidence and my own account as a first-hand witness, that it was a natural death,” she said."

","WAS young Naqeebullah Mehsud really the internal migrant he appeared to be, trying to eke out a living far from home? ,Those who knew him insist that this was the case — indeed, his Facebook page features photographs that bear out their claim that he had aspirations of becoming a model. Or was he, as the police claim, a militant involved in major acts of terrorism, with links to the TTP and other banned groups? ,Only an investigation can confirm his credentials — we only know that , on the outskirts of Karachi last week. ,So far, however, no evidence has emerged about any crime being committed — notwithstanding police allegations, specifically those made by SSP Rao Anwar who headed the team involved in the ‘encounter’ killing. ,Tragically, there was no adherence to due process and the fundamental right of the accused to defend himself. With Naqeebullah’s body being handed over to his family on Wednesday, one of his relatives claimed that earlier this month, the deceased had been whisked away from his garments shop in Sohrab Goth by men in plain clothes. ,On Thursday, the Sindh home minister took notice of Naqeebullah’s death and ordered the DIG police South to personally conduct an inquiry. But the clean-up needs to go much further.,The phenomenon of ‘encounters’ is a euphemism for extra-judicial killings a consequence of the failing of the justice system and the rot within police departments. ,In Karachi, this travesty of justice has become so frequent that SSP Anwar has been given the moniker of ‘encounter specialist’ — all under the very nose of both superiors in the police department and the provincial government. The practice has to be brought to an end. ,Now that the Supreme Court has saved the job of Sindh police chief A.D. Khowaja, this is a pressing challenge that he must take up at the earliest. "

The pattern of abduction, rape and killing of Zainab Ameen is similar to the ordeal the eight other girls had gone through before. We have several leads and will arrest the suspect soon,” the additional chief secretary of Punjab, Umar Rasool, assured the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Human Rights. ,Besides the additional chief secretary, additional inspector general (AIG) of police, deputy commissioner and district police officer (DPO) of Kasur and officials of the Ministry of Human Rights briefed the committee which met on Thursday to discuss the Zainab murder case. ,The killing of six-year-old Zainab hit the headlines last week when her body was found in a rubbish heap near her home in Kasur city. ,Officials assure NA panel suspect will be caught soon ,Mr Rasool informed the committee about how the victim was reported missing on Jan 4 and her body found four days later. He said that after the door-to-door search, raids and interrogating some 1,500 individuals, all evidence — including CCTV footage — had been sent to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency to ascertain the identity of the serial killer. ,After the formation of a joint investigation team comprising officials of the police, an intelligence agency and the Special Branch, DNA samples of 432 suspects had been secured, Mr Rasool said. ,Responding to questions by members of the committee as to how soon the suspect in the Zainab murder case would be arrested, AIG Abubakar Khuda Bakhsh did not make a promise. ,“We have several leads. We cannot exercise the traditional methods of police torture to extort confessions. Arrest will be made based on scientific and technical evidence, including DNA comparisons. We would like to assure the committee that everybody is trying to arrest the suspect,” the AIG said. ,He informed the committee that the DNA testing was introduced in 2004 in the Punjab University. One DNA test costs between Rs60,000 and Rs70,000 and the final results could take a few days. ,In response to a question by the committee chairman, Babar Nawaz Khan of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, about the progress in the Zainab case, Kasur DPO Abdul Quddus said that 500 DNA samples had been collected over the past three to four days. ,All intelligence agencies were working to find the suspect, he added. ,Some members of the committee criticised the Punjab government for poor security measures in Kasur, the city which has witnessed many cases of assaults on minor boys and girls. ,Mr Rasool informed the committee that the plan to install 450 security cameras had already been approved by the Punjab chief minister on an emergency basis. ,The committee chairman deplored that the Punjab government waited too long to take security measures. ,After an hour or so of discussion on the case, the chairman suspended the meeting which coincided with the ongoing session of the Natio­nal Assembly.

The victims included citizens of the United States, India, Pakistan, Britain, Italy, Denmark, Ireland and Mexico. ,The FBI has age-progressed photos of the four hijackers — Wadoud Muhammad Hafiz al-Turki, Jamal Saeed Abdul Rahim, Muhammad Abdullah Khalil Hussain ar-Rahayyal and Muhammad Ahmed al-Munawar — to enable people to identify them. ,Since two Americans were also among those killed in the failed attempt, the FBI is legally bound to continue to seek the suspects until they are either brought to the United States for trial or their death is confirmed. ,			
,In the tragedy at Karachi airport, 20 passengers and crew were killed ,The US State Department is also offering a $5 million reward for information leading to their arrest, through its Rewards for Justice Programme. ,The four suspects are believed to have been members of the Abu Nidal Organisation, which was designated a terrorist organisation by the US Department of State. Each of the men is on the FBI’s Most Wanted Terrorists List. The case is being investigated by the agency’s Washington Field Office. ,The FBI statement said that it’s “hoping to generate new leads” with the release of new age-progressed images of four alleged hijackers. ,“It’s always been an active case of ours,” said the lead FBI agent on the case. He said images of the suspects obtained by the FBI in the year 2000 were age-progressed by the FBI Laboratory. “We’re hoping that with the age-progression photos next to the original photos maybe that will jar some memories or maybe someone has seen these guys walking around.” ,			
,Anyone with information in the case is asked to contact the FBI or submit a tip at https://tips.fbi.gov. ,According to the FBI, Wadoud Muhammad Hafiz al-Turki was born on June 21, 1955 in Baghdad; Jamal Saeed Abdul Rahim on Sept 5, 1965 in Lebanon; Muhammad Abdullah Khalil Hussain ar-Rahayyal on Nov 27, 1965 in Lebanon; and Muhammad Ahmed al-Munawar on May 21, 1965 in Kuwait.

The Pan American World Airways Flight 73 was preparing to depart Jinnah International Airport for Frankfurt, and then to its final destination, John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York, when a group of five hijackers seized the plane. ,The leader of the group Zayd Hassan Abd al-Latif Masud al-Safarini, also a Palestinian, was prominent member of the Abu Nidal group. ,The 17-hour long hijacking came to an end when the hijackers opened fire on passengers at 9.30pm, causing Pakistani commandos to raid the plane. The SSG commando unit was headed by Brigadier Tariq Mehmood, one of Pakistan’s most decorated soldiers. They freed the aircraft and captured the hijackers. ,At a trial held in 1988, all of the convicts admitted to having carried out the hijacking and were given death sentences that were later commuted to life imprisonment. ,			
,Safarini was released from prison in Pakistan in 2001 but was arrested a day later by FBI agents in Bangkok on his way to Jordan. In May 2004, a US federal judge in Washington sentenced him to 160 years at Super Max prison in Colorado. ,Four other hijackers were released after completing their jail terms and deported to the Palestinian territories.

761,2018-01-19,The child rape victims of Quetta,"
,
,
, ,-year-old Nazeer* has been frequenting Quetta’s Liaquat Bazaar, famous for stocking mobile phones, clothes and locally made ornaments. The teenager, whose family settled in the city after fleeing Afghanistan, is nonchalant about the daily horror he endures: ""I have sex with men for money. And this bazaar has many clients"".,He has already met with a 'client' earlier today. The man was a local shopkeeper who took the boy to a hotel and carried out the act for Rs150 (US $1.3). Nazeer says he had to haggle with the man to get the price above Rs100 ($1).,			
,The teenager was first abused when he was nine by a neighbour who lived along the city’s seven-kilometre Sabzal Road. ,“He said he would pay me. I desperately needed the money. He raped me, but I was not paid a penny. I did not even understand what had been done to me at that time,” Nazeer shares. ,“My family has no knowledge of any of this... They think I work in the bazaar”.,Nazeer's case is not unique. Poverty stricken minors roam the garrison city enduring horrors at the hands of sexual predators who act with complete impunity. The abuse often transpires in workshops or seedy hotels available at low hourly rates. Quetta’s Sattar Road, for instance, is dotted with such establishments, some of which are well known to be involved in child prostitution.,With no fear of being caught, the perpetrators who walk along these streets speak openly about their exploits.,One man, who shares that he works at the Pakistan-Iran border near Taftan, frequents the city’s shabby 'Four Seasons Hotel' once every two months. ,""A room at the establishment rents out at Rs1,000 per night to regulars. Another Rs1,000 guarantee “special service”, he says.,Now nearing 30 and married with two children, he says he has been coercing young boys into sex since his school days. He terms his continuous cycle of abuse, ""A habit"".,An aged tailor in Liaquat Bazaar, has a similar story to narrate. Hunched over his sewing machine, the family man with children of his own shows no remorse as he admits to sexually abusing boys. ""I still do it,"" he says, ""Boys who do not have money. They are willing in exchange for cash... they have to comply. And I can take them anywhere without fear. No one will question me.”,As he returns to his work, he shares that he was raped at the age of 14. He claims it was this trauma that drove him to sexually abuse boys “as revenge” for what was done to him.,Another perpetrator says he rapes children to 'shame them'. ,""It is a fitting lesson... If these boys become doctors, engineers, functionaries and not even glance at people like me, I want them to remember what I did."",			
,			
,heer desperation and poverty drove Yousaf* into the trade.,Hailing from Balochistan’s Chaman district, he says there was no money to be had at home. It was then that he was made his first offer. ,“A few years back, I went to a wedding in another town. It was there that I befriended two men. During my stay, they gifted me Rs2,000 for just spending some time with them. But the following day, they blackmailed me into having sex for having taken the money,” he says. ,From there, the ordeal spun out of his control. ""They continued blackmailing me. One by one, their friends abused me. This is how it went on for some time. I could not do anything.”,“Had I not taken their money, I would not have had to face that,” he says. ""But Rs2,000 seemed like a princely sum at the time. I willingly took the money without realising what they would want in return.”  ,			
,			
,he impunity with which predators operate leads to abuse beyond the poorest of the poor as well. And sometimes it is a coordinated effort that is part of the racket.,Basit*, a resident of Sariab Road, says he was gang-raped by four men when he was 16. The teenager was on his way to school when he was kidnapped at gunpoint. He was brought to Killi, a Quetta suburb, where he was raped and the ordeal photographed. ,Left alone for a period, Basit heard the men discussing a plan to use the photographs to blackmail his father for Rs200,000. These men were not just rapists interested in pleasure; they were a gang profiting from sexual abuse. ,They were deliberating among themselves in another room when Basit fled from the spot by scaling a wall. Shots were fired as he escaped, but the teenager reached home safely. A case was registered, but it remains pending before the Supreme Court of Pakistan. ,Lawyers approached for a comment on child sex abuse cases point out that complaints are rarely filed, with most cases being settled out of court by tribal elders. ,			
,A quick search through court records yields only 12 cases of “unnatural offences”. According to one lawyer, many cases find no takers as established lawyers avoid rape cases due to low remuneration. Some refuse such cases because they believe it brings their profession into disrepute. As a result, the cases are almost exclusively handled by junior lawyers. But it isn't just the legal system that is failing abused children. ,Rights activist Abdul Sattar points out that the process of reporting such incidents is cumbersome due to weak, overburdened or or non-existent systems at police stations and health facilities.,“Cases are not reported unless a child has been grievously injured,” Sattar says, adding that another major impediment is the time frame in which a victim is required to undergo a medical examination – if it is not conducted within 24 hours of the abuse, the occurrence cannot be corroborated. Similarly, he adds, the first 48 hours are critical when it comes to collecting evidence e.g. clothes bearing traces of semen. But a majority of cases are reported two to three days after the abuse occurs, resulting in failure to corroborate rape charges. ,According to Sattar, it becomes almost impossible to register a complaint within the time frame as there are too few medical officers tasked with formulating reports on rape cases. “There are (only) two or three such officers in Quetta. Timely availability of their services across Balochistan is impossible. Consequently, most reported cases of child sex abuse stand uncorroborated.” ,With no consequences to committing the crime, and a system that works against them, boys like Nazeer and Yousaf are forced to internalise sexual abuse as a part of everyday reality. ,They continue their daily walk down Quetta's streets."

He claimed that Mehsud's criminal activities were on record; however, certain elements were trying to present the latter as an innocent citizen to ""frame"" Anwar for political reasons. ,""Those who work [honestly] have to bear such allegations and challenges,"" he said, adding that he was being targeted by some ""political elements"".  ,""He was 100 per cent a terrorist,"" Anwar claimed, alleging that Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) was trying to malign him because he had lodged two FIRs against PTI member Haleem Adil Sheikh.,Talking to the media earlier, DIG East-Zone Sultan Ali Khowaja, who is a member of the inquiry committee, said that Mehsud's familly had also been ordered to appear before the commission.

Many people have called me and suggested that culprits of such heinous crimes should be hanged in public. According to section 364-A of the Pakistan Penal Code, a person can be given the death penalty, life imprisonment or a minimum of seven years of imprisonment for kidnapping or murdering a child of less than 14 years.

802,2018-01-23,Murder by police,"A TRAGIC death in Karachi has shone a much-needed spotlight on a dark practice of elements within the state. ,The euphemism of ‘encounters’ and clinical terms such as ‘extrajudicial killings’ hide the true horror of what it is: premeditated murder by men in uniform, the very people tasked with protecting the public. ,Naqeebullah Mehsud, taken into custody by the police in Karachi and almost certainly killed by elements within the force, has become the wrenchingly human face of a grotesque practice against the citizenry. ,It is hoped that Naqeebullah’s killers will be identified and punished under the law while all elements in the chain of command who condone such practices are identified, expelled from the police and other parts of the state, and punished appropriately. ,There can be no room in the 21st century and more than seven decades of this country’s existence for barbaric, antediluvian practices.,What is truly needed is an honest reckoning with such practices across the country. ,Police practices in Karachi may be under intense scrutiny at the moment, but the problem is undeniably national. Indeed, over the decades, some policemen have forged a defiant, tough-guy image by becoming known for illegal practices. In Punjab, a crime wave, be it so-called dacoits, kidnappers or sex criminals, has been routinely dealt with by sending in policemen willing to do the unconscionable. ,In Balochistan, the security apparatus has near total impunity. ,In Sindh, the systemic politicisation of the police force has left both rural and urban denizens mostly terrified of contact with it. In KP, commendable new police reforms could usher in an era of significant, positive change, but the militant threat has almost certainly helped gloss over regular abuses. ,Across the country, instead of respecting the police, the public almost always fears the law enforcers.,Equally true is that the police forces themselves have been demoralised by political interference, a lack of necessary investment and poor training. ,Arguably, no one sets out to be a monster in uniform and there are honest, professional and humane policemen across the country. ,But there does appear to be a new impunity rising under the garb of counterterrorism operations. The terror threat and the public’s legitimate fears appear to have created the space for a new generation of policemen who are willing to align with elements within the state to both enrich themselves and terrorise the public. ,Naqeebullah’s death in Karachi has triggered an avalanche of anecdotal evidence and personal accounts of police excesses in the name of fighting terrorism. ,Long term, the corrosive effects on the security apparatus itself could be catastrophic. ,In the near term, it is vital that the citizens be protected from corrupt elements within the state willing to inflict violence on the vulnerable. Naqeebullah Mehsud’s tragic, vile killing could be the right moment to effect systemic change."

,""Our collective effort has borne fruit and the murderer has been arrested,"" a triumphant Sharif announced to loud applause.,The Punjab CM thanked various ministers, officials and civilian and military intelligence agencies for tracking down the rapist after a 14-day effort.,He said DNA samples from 1,150 people were profiled and once the culprit was caught, his DNA matched a ""100 per cent"" with the samples collected from the crime scene. ,Sharif also said the suspect was given a polygraph test earlier today, which leaves only 5pc doubt as to his culpability. However, he said the suspect had ""accepted all of his deeds"" during the test which removed any remaining doubt.,The case ""is an example for the nation that when we unite, we can achieve anything"", Sharif said.,			
,He said while the first phase of the investigation has been completed with the identification of the suspect, the second was to bring this ""beast"" to justice.,""If it were up to me, as a person who understands some of [Zainab's father's] pain, I would want him hanged on the chowk [square],"" the chief minister said, adding that he will request the chief justice of Lahore High Court (LHC) to ensure that the culprit is made an example of.,""If the law allows, he [the rapist] should be hanged at the square."",Sharif said had it not been for the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA), the suspect would not have been caught. He said a DNA matching conducted for the second time had confirmed that the arrested suspect is the only culprit.,Recalling the processes involved in the investigation of the case, the chief minister said the effort entailed search operations, geo-fencing, forensic analysis of the crime scene, enhancement of videos of the crime scenes, collection of DNA samples, collection of Nadra pictorial data of 300,000 people and gleaning information from labourers and masons. ""Scientific and human intelligence"" was used during the probe, he added.,Sharif urged other provincial governments and political parties to ""not do politics on dead bodies"" and instead address the challenges faced by the country collectively.,Asked by a reporter whether Zainab and other children would have been alive today had the serial killer been caught in the first instance, the chief minister said: ""I agree with you 100pc, but this is a moment to appreciate. Accountability will take place of the other [seven cases] as well."",The parents of the other seven children will get justice as well, Sharif added.,The director general of PFSA gave a presentation about the scientific analysis of Imran's DNA. He said the suspect's DNA sample had been collected on January 20 and the profiling was completed in two days.,According to the forensics lab official, the random match probability of Imran's DNA profile is ,.,""It means [that] if there are 178 quadrillion male people at one place, [the] chance of having this profile is only 01 which is Imran's DNA profile,"" he explained.,""World population is 7 billion, [which] means he is the only one on this planet Earth who has this DNA profile."",Speaking at the press conference, Zainab's father, Muhammad Amin, thanked the provincial and federal authorities and said he was satisfied with the result of the investigation.,Earlier in the day, Kasur had turned tense as residents surrounded the house of the suspect, Imran, after police said they had arrested him in connection with Zainab's rape and murder.,As a mob began gathering the suspect's house, police also reached the area urging people to remain calm in order to avoid any untoward incident. Television footage showed a contingent of police in riot gear deployed to secure the surrounding area.,Police sources earlier told , that Imran is a resident of the same area where Zainab's house is located, and lives very close to the victim's aunt's house. ,His appearance matched that of an individual seen with Zainab in CCTV footage recovered by police, according to the sources.,He was arrested as part of the investigation much earlier, but was let go, the sources said, following which he fled Kasur. Addressing this point in his presser, Shahbaz Sharif said the suspect had been initially interrogated and during the investigation he made the excuse that he has suffered a heart attack. But he was later caught after the DNA profiling was completed, he said.,Malik Ahmed Khan, a spokesperson for the Punjab government, told , that the suspect had now been arrested from Pakpattan.,Khan, citing police, said that the suspect used to frequently disguise his appearance. ""Sometimes he would keep a beard, sometimes he would wear spectacles, and he would change his clothes,"" Khan said, adding that some of the suspect's accomplices are also in police custody. ,He said that all other suspects who had been arrested earlier were released when DNA reports cleared them. ,On January 4, Zainab had gone missing after leaving her house on Kasur's Road Kot area for her maternal aunt's house a few minutes away for religious lessons. ,A few days later, the victim's body was recovered from a trash heap. An autopsy confirmed that she was strangled to death. It also suggested that she had been raped before being killed., that the results of DNA tests carried out in the wake of the rape and murder of Zainab in Kasur indicated the involvement of one culprit in at least seven similar cases that occurred in the district over the past year.,Zainab's rape and murder had sparked outrage in Kasur and across the country. The day her body was found, protesters had taken to the streets in Kasur, agitating against perceived police inaction."

However, SP Anwar was not taken into custody till late in the night.,Terrorism section also added to the FIR against former Malir SSP,“The FIR was lodged in the evening that would follow the required legal process,” DIG-East Sultan Ali Khowaja said when asked about the expected arrest of SP Anwar. ,According to the contents of the FIR, Naqeeb was picked up on Jan 3 afternoon with two of his friends from a roadside teashop on Abul Hasan Ispahani Road by “SP Rao Anwar’s men” in plain clothes. Later, his two friends were released on Jan 6. But after a few days, on Jan 17 the family came to know through news channels about the killing of Naqeeb in an encounter.,Referring to the findings of the police inquiry committee which found that Naqeeb was killed in a “fake encounter” “staged” by SP Anwar on Jan 13, the victim’s father asked in the FIR that the officer be booked under ATA and other relevant clauses of the penal code. ,Before the FIR was lodged, the inquiry team — headed by Additional IG and Counter-Terrorism Department chief Dr Sanaullah Abbasi and comprising DIG-East Khowaja and DIG-South Azad Khan — visited the protest camp set up by area people off the Superhighway to meet the victim’s father.,In a brief speech to the protesters, CTD chief Abbasi assured them of a speedy probe and meeting all legal formalities to serve justice. He also asked them to cooperate with the inquiry committee and investigation team for a better coordination and desired results. ,Later talking to the media, he rejected an impression about any pressure he and his team was facing during the probe against a “well-connected Rao Anwar”.,“We found that it was a fake encounter within first 14 hours,” he told a questioner. “If there was any pressure, we would not have been able to come to this conclusion and share it with the media. There is no pressure and our actions are justifying our claims. From arrest to prosecution, any process required by the law... you would see that happening. 
No one is above the law.”,Naqeeb was the owner of a shop and fond of modelling. A day after the alleged encounter, his acquaintances and relatives had disputed the police claim that the deceased was a militant affiliated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). ,A protest by civil society, criticism from political parties and a social media campaign attracted action from the Sindh government when Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had taken notice of his death that led to the formation of an inquiry committee.,Authorities in the Sindh police removed SP Anwar from the office of the Malir SSP and wrote to the Sindh government to suspend him from service.,SP Anwar had also announced boycott of the proceedings of the inquiry committee and since then mysteriously disappeared.

816,2018-01-24,Shahbaz's move to switch off Zainab's father's mic raises eyebrows,"Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif's move to switch off the mic of Haji Amin Ansari, the father of Zainab Amin, , has raised eyebrows, with many speculating over the possible reasons behind the action.,The chief minister had on Tuesday evening announced the arrest of Zainab's suspected killer and rapist at a press conference in Lahore. The child's father was allowed to speak briefly after the provincial authorities ended their briefing, but netizens are questioning why he was abruptly cut off.,Haji Ameen, speaking to , on Wednesday, said: ""After I put forward our demand for a death sentence [of the suspect], the CM switched off both of the mics [in front of me]."",			
,The televised broadcast of the press conference had shown Ameen thanking the Punjab government, law enforcement agencies, the military and courts for their assistance in the investigation of his daughter's murder. He had acknowledged that the suspect had been arrested due to everyone's collective efforts. ,However, as Ameen finished his sentence, the Punjab chief minister leaned over to switch off the mics placed before the victim's father.,Zainab's father, while speaking to ,, claimed that he had earlier handed over a list of demands to Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah, which included an appeal that the government take measures so that no other children are abducted and raped in Kasur in the future. ,Prior to the recent flood of cases, Kasur has long been infamous for child sex abuse cases, especially since authorities uncovered a huge paedophilia ring in the city in 2015. Rights organisations had found  that at least 280 children were sexually abused on camera by men who later blackmailed their families, threatening to leak the footage.,However, Amin alleged that Sanaullah had told him to stick to demanding the public hanging of the accused during the press conference.,Footage recorded before the press conference showed Sanaullah tutoring Amin on what to say during the announcement. ,In Punjabi, Sanaullah said he was unaware of the demands Amin had prepared and advised him to demand only punishment for the suspect during the press conference, as any other demands ""would not seem appropriate"". ,He could be heard assuring Amin that his demands could be discussed separately.,Zainab's father, when questioned about the press conference, last night had said that the law minister asked him ""to only demand a public hanging and speak about my other demands later."" ,""Obviously, I had said certain things before the media [about Rana Sanaullah] and condemned his statements [...] so he may have felt that I might say something along those lines,"" he reflected. ,Separately, Zainab's mother, while speaking to , today, also took issue with the audience at the press conference applauding the investigators during the announcement of the capture of Zainab's alleged killer. ,""I am very upset. We are suffering, and they have clapped over our suffering and tears,"" she said. ""The suspect was allowed to get away with his deeds for two-and-a-half years - were they clapping for that?"",When asked whether she recognised the suspect, she claimed he was a stranger to her. ,Zainab's mother also demanded that the authorities ""chop off the suspect's hands immediately for strangling children"". She further called for him to be ""stoned by the public as hanging was not harsh enough punishment"" in her view.,Police had launched a manhunt for Zainab's killer after the recovery of her body from a trash heap in Kasur on January 9 sparked widespread outrage and protests across the country. She had gone missing on January 4. An autopsy confirmed that she was strangled to death and raped before being killed.,The prime suspect, Muhammad Imran Ali, was arrested by police after his DNA matched the samples taken from the crime scene. ,Zainab's father, while speaking to ,, also questioned how the suspect's family was unaware of his activities.,""How is it possible that he kept a child at the house for five days and his family didn't know? They even saw the CCTV footage. Other people might not have recognised him, but family members would have been able to,"" he said."
817,2018-01-24,A licence to kill,"			
,THE brutal murder of young Naqeebullah Mehsud in a fake encounter has shaken the nation and raised questions about the apparent impunity that some members of the law enforcement enjoy. It is indeed not the first case of extrajudicial killing in this country; the only difference between this and other case is that the media backlash and protest by the civil society forced the administration to act this time. ,Hundreds of alleged terrorists have reportedly been killed by law-enforcement agencies in recent years without being identified. They are just numbers. While such cases have been reported from across the country it has almost become a norm in Karachi. Finding mutilated bodies of persons after they were picked up by the security agencies is a common phenomenon. ,Given this situation, an incident like Naqeebullah’s death was waiting to happen. There were three other ‘suspected terrorists’ reportedly killed in the same ‘encounter’, but nothing is known about their identity. Last week’s incident is symptomatic of a more serious problem — the breakdown of the rule of law. ,It is not just about Rao Anwar. He is a product of a system that sanctions extra-legal actions.,Rao Anwar, who is being held responsible for Mehsud’s coldblooded murder, had earlier been eulogised as a daredevil officer and referred to as the ‘encounter specialist’. He was untouchable, reportedly having enjoyed the blessing of the security establishment as well as the top PPP leadership. He has been a familiar name in Karachi since the 1990s when he earned notoriety for his role in the operation against the MQM. ,Rising from the ranks, he owes his senior position to powerful backers. He would certainly deliver what was expected of him. That, it seems, gave him a licence to kill. It is not the first time he has been suspended from the job, but he always came back. His refusal to appear before an inquiry committee indicates defiance that has become his hallmark. ,But it is not just about Rao Anwar. He is a product of a system that sanctions extra-legal actions. Custodial killings and fake encounters have become a way to deal with suspected criminals, militants and sectarian extremists not only in Karachi but across the country. And it is not just the police but intelligence agencies and the paramilitary forces too that are involved in extrajudicial killings. The ongoing conflict and insurgency in the tribal areas provided a justification for this impunity.  ,A case in point is Balochistan where bodies of disappeared persons were dumped regularly. It was certainly not the police or other civilian law-enforcement agencies responsible for those killings. The low-intensity insurgency in the province and involvement of foreign-backed separatists has been used as an excuse by the security agencies for taking extreme actions. But such actions have been counterproductive and have further alienated the population. In fact, such indiscriminate use of force is a major cause of public discontent in the province. ,Indeed, the situation in the tribal areas where the militants had challenged the writ of the state is different. The killing of militants in combat is not the same as extrajudicial action. But there is always a question about custodial deaths. The suspects must be tried in a court of law rather than eliminated. It may be true that a weak legal system and prosecution often allow even hard-core terrorists to go scot-free. Yet extrajudicial actions are not the solution. The excesses perpetrated by the security agencies in conflict zones are often used by the militants to mobilise support. ,Karachi’s case has been very different. The country’s largest city and economic jugular had become a hub for criminal gangs backed by political parties vying for the control of the city. The battle turned the city into a lawless region. More serious was the influx of militants fleeing the military operation in the tribal areas; they had established their stronghold in the outskirts of the city.  ,In those areas, police control had virtually collapsed. Indeed, the turnaround over the last few years, bringing some semblance of normality in the city, is remarkable. The credit for it certainly goes to the police, Rangers and other security agencies. But it is also a fact that scores of suspected militants as well as members of some political parties have been killed in so-called encounters as well as in the custody of security agencies.  ,For sure, many of them might have been wanted in militant and terrorist activities, but such actions do not provide a long-term solution. A licence to kill makes incidents like last week’s inevitable. Naqeebullah’s case generated much public backlash because he was active on social media and known in the area for his flamboyance, but there may be other innocent victims whose deaths in fake encounters have gone unnoticed. A judicial inquiry must be conducted to probe other complaints too. ,Rao Anwar and other alleged perpetrators of the crime must be punished. It will indeed help prevent such excess use of power and authority in future. More important, however, is to reform the police system that produces officers like Rao Anwar. His impunity came from political patronage.  ,Not that the police system is much better in other provinces, but the Sindh police has earned greater notoriety. There is a need for improving the judicial and monitoring system too. Action against one officer will not change the culture of misuse of power. There is a need to strengthen the system of check and balances.  ,While it is important for the media to highlight the cases of police excesses, there is also a need to be careful not to demoralise the entire force that has contributed immensely to getting Karachi back to normal. There is always a danger that demonisation of the law-enforcement agencies could affect the police officers engaged in a counterterrorism drive. A senior police officer rightly pointed out that no officer should go to the job worried about the consequences of his action. But no one should have the impunity to use power indiscriminately. ,

820,2018-01-25,Father insists on SSP’s involvement in Intizar’s murder,"KARACHI: As the father of Intizar Ahmed insisted on the involvement of Anti-Car Lifting Cell’s (ACLC) former chief SSP Muqaddas Haider in the killing of his son, investigators on Wednesday claimed to have recorded the senior police officer’s statement. ,Intizar had allegedly been killed by officials of the ACLC when they opened fire on his car on Khayaban-i-Ittehad for not stopping it at their indication on Jan 13. ,The investigators also claimed to have recorded the statement of a girl, Madiha Kayani, who was travelling with the victim at the time of the incident but silently disappeared from the crime scene instead of reporting it to the police, raising suspicion about her involvement in the crime. ,In the next phase, the investigators said, they would collect cellphone data of both persons and all the nine ACLC personnel. ,The fresh series of allegations from the victim’s family had also convinced the police authorities to record the statement of Intizar’s father, Ishtiaq Ahmed, again. ,Counter-Terrorism Department’s DIG Amir Farooqi, who is investigating the murder on the directives of the Sindh IGP, told Dawn that they had recorded the statements of former ACLC SSP Muqaddas Haider and Madiha Kayani.  “Mr Haider told the investigators that he did not know Intizar and Madiha, and had never met them. ,“Similarly, Madiha said she did not know Muqaddas,” the DIG said. ,Answering a question, Mr Farooqi said they were also trying to determine personal enmity behind the murder as the father of the victim had said he did not believe that his son was killed just for not stopping his car."

But the child's sudden death raised police suspicion, “following which I directed the station house officer Chakesar to launch an inquiry [of the case] under the supervision of SP Investigation Shangla Khalid Khan"".,The inquiry began a week ago after exhumation of the girl's body and a medical report later revealed signs of physical torture on the victim, he added.,According to the DPO, the girl's father in his statement recorded before the court revealed that his daughter had been killed by his second wife over a domestic dispute. However, the man kept silent about the crime and helped his wife bury the girl. ,The accused woman told both police and the court that she had killed her stepdaughter because she used to quarrel with her regularly over minor issues.

822,2018-01-25,Intizar murder case: Investigators probing element of ‘personal enmity’,"Investigators are trying to determine whether the , in Karachi's Defence Housing Authority, allegedly at the hands of police personnel, could have been the result of personal enmity. ,On January 14, Intizar was chased down and shot dead allegedly by nine undercover personnel of Anti-Car Lifting Cell (ACLC) after he had reportedly failed to stop his car at a picket.,Counter-Terrorism Department DIG Amir Farooqi told , that investigators are probing the element of personal enmity after Ishtiaq Ahmed, the father of the victim, expressed reservations that those “actually involved” in the murder of his son were not being taken to task.,Intizar's father has refused to believe the police version that his son was shot dead by ACLC officials because he failed to stop his car when flagged and insisted that recently-removed senior superintendent of police ACLC Muqaddas Haider was involved in the killing. ,In the wake of Intizar's father's allegations, investigators on Wednesday recorded the statement of Haider, and the girl who was accompanying the victim at the time of the incident and has been blamed by his family for causing the teenager's death. ,DIG Farooqi, who was , by the inspector general of Sindh police, told , on Wednesday that they have recorded statements of former ACLC SSP Haider and the girl.

He was in his car with a female friend when police in plainclothes had reportedly signalled him to stop. When he had failed to oblige, he was chased and gunned down.

823,2018-01-25,Muted relief in Kasur that ‘serial killer’ is off the streets,"KASUR / LAHORE: Little Zainab’s house in Kasur was a site of much activity on Wednesday, a day after the Punjab government revealed that they had nabbed the culprit who had raped and murdered the eight-year-old girl as well as seven others. ,The suspect was produced before an antiterrorism court on Wednesday, and was given into the custody of the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) for 14 days on physical remand. The police are expected to conduct further interrogation and establish his involvement in other incidents of rape and murder of children in Kasur.,There was a sense of muted relief among the visitors thronging the victim’s house all day. Many said they were relieved that a serial rapist and murderer was off the streets, while others said they were glad that law enforcement agencies would now stop taking citizens into custody to obtain tissue samples for DNA profiling for the case.,Antiterrorism court remands suspect in 14-day custody of Counter Terrorism Department ,An elderly man said there was no remedy for the humiliation an innocent person underwent when taken into custody on suspicion of raping and killing innocent children. “It is a nightmare that haunts you your whole life,” he said. ,Speaking to ,, Zainab’s father Muhammad Amin insisted that the legal hurdles in the way of a public hanging should be removed so that the serial rapist and murderer could be made an example of. He added that Senator Rehman Malik had told him that an amendment in the law, pertaining to rape and murder of children, was almost final.,The victim’s mother, on the other hand, remained inconsolable. If the police had done their job earlier and arrested the culprit when the first cases were reported, Zainab and several other girls would still be alive, she said. ,A police official told Dawn that they had first become suspicious about the involvement of 23-year-old Imran Ali, after they learned that he had changed his appearance soon after surveillance video footage, showing the kidnapper and the victim, was released. The suspect had left the district several times before he was eventually apprehended., Another investigator said the suspect was arrested based on intelligence reports based on information gathered from locals. He said DNA profiling and polygraph tests had helped them zero in on the serial killer.,The law enforcement official dispelled the impression that the suspect’s mother had helped the police catch him, and added they had arrested the suspect from his house. The police had taken several of his family members into custody, and several cops were deputed on duty at his house. ,He said that the suspect was a member of Naat councils and it was hard to expect such brutality from him. The policeman said that though the suspect had no spiritual compulsion to carry out the murders, he told them that he would always ask God for forgiveness after committing the crimes. ,His fellow reciters at the Naat councils Imran was a member of, were quick to distance themselves from him. They described him as having a “strange” behaviour, and added that he rarely ever mixed with other Naat reciters. Some of them said that he was only interested in collecting the money he was owed at Naat gatherings, and quickly left after they ended. The suspect’s visiting card introduces him as “Fakhr-i-Punjab” and the “voice of your heart”, and includes his contact details for those interested in soliciting his services at Naat gatherings. ,On Wednesday, the suspect was brought to the antiterrorism court in Lahore with his face covered in an Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC). Strict security measures were taken around the court premises. ,“Where is his beard?” was the first question ATC judge Sajjad Ahmad asked after the investigation officer uncovered the suspect’s face. The judge noted that the CCTV footage had shown the suspect to have a bearded face.,Senior prosecutor Abdul Rauf Wattoo told the court that the suspect had shaved his beard off after committing the crime. ,To another query, the prosecutor said that the police had arrested the suspect on the basis of DNA results which had matched the results of swabs taken from the victim’s body. He said the DNA had also established the suspect’s involvement in eight other incidents that had occurred in Kasur over the past several months. He added that one of his victims was still being treated at the Children’s Hospital.,The officer presented the report of the suspect’s polygraph test wherein, he said, the suspect had confessed to his crime. The judge then asked the prosecutor to explain the legal value of a polygraph test at the next hearing.,The officer told the court that the police were yet to ascertain the location where the suspect used to take his victims.,Responding to one of the queries, he told the court that the suspect used to lure children by offering them candies or money to gain their trust. The officer submitted a written request for 15-day physical remand of the suspect, however, the judge allowed him custody for 14 days."
824,2018-01-25,'Why is DNA evidence not given weight in Pakistani courts?',"LAHORE: “It is nobody else on this planet but him [Imran Ali]. The DNA shows a match and that is the gold standard,” says Dr Muhammad Ashraf Tahir, director general of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA). ,Dr Tahir is referring to the suspect in the rape and murder of eight-year-old Zainab Ameen. She was brutally raped and killed after being abducted from her neighbourhood in Kasur’s Road Kot area. ,“Every contact leaves a trace, and forensic scientists find traces to make associations,” he adds. ,But while the DG takes pride in the capabilities of his state-of-the-art forensics lab — a sprawling structure built in 2011 with a budget of Rs2.5 billion — he is frustrated by how little importance Pakistan’s criminal justice system assigns to evidence. ,“Ocular evidence [eyewitness testimony] is considered number one in our courts, which is really ridiculous to hear because ocular evidence can be totally false,” he says. ,“I have never seen a genuine eyewitness. And even if it is a genuine eyewitness, how can someone explain or recall for instance the colour of a shirt if the interaction has been for a short time? And here people claim that they have witnessed a murder in the dark of the night.” ,He calls for a reshaping of the law to give priority to physical evidence. “Physical evidence is a silent witness in a court of law. Fingerprints, saliva etc speak against perpetrators.”,Hurdles in collection and dependence on police Senior scientist Nasir Siddique, who heads the DNA section at the PFSA, says there are challenges in the collection process. ,“Our forensic teams are trained and equipped to collect and store samples. But in majority of the cases, doctors and police are the ones to send the evidence over to us,” says Siddique. ,“They don’t send well-packaged, exact or timely evidence to our section. So, if there is a rape case for example, we need to correctly preserve swabs and clothing but the police often don’t perform the correct procedures,” he claims. ,Manager of the pathology department at the agency, Dr Nasir Iqbal says the delays are detrimental to an investigation. “DNA samples should not be delayed.” ,Dr Iqbal says the PFSA has satellite centres at the division level throughout Punjab. But they are only activated when the police inform the technical teams of the crime. “Our teams go to crime scenes and collect samples if they are informed but if the police don’t ask us to go, we cannot -- we are dependent on them.” ,The DG also admits that in “at least 60pc of cases”, evidence is collected by police. ,“We are a support service for law-enforcement agencies. We visit crime scenes upon request of police. A lot of times, the police don’t call us. In the beginning they were hesitant but now they are picking up,” says Dr Tahir. ,He adds: “If samples are not collected properly, stored properly, packaged properly and evidence gets lost, the chances of solving cases are low.” ,Dr Tahir says, however, that efforts have been made to train LEAs. The PFSA has trained 14,000 personnel in the last four years. ,“It is in our benefit, because if we get the right evidence it is easy for us to work. Our existence is only on the basis of successful prosecution. If we cannot provide evidence for prosecution, this is a waste of money and resources,” he says."

The bereaved family contested the claim by saying there was no water in the canal and that there was absolutely no reason for the girl to end her life. ,Police had registered a murder case on the insistence of the family that she was abducted and killed. ,Now they have urged Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif to take notice of the case and ensure arrest of the killers."

,But hours after he was taken into custody, Mudassir was killed in an alleged police 'encounter', reportedly after he tried to escape detention. ,New details that have emerged almost a year later suggest that Mudassir was allegedly murdered by police, since Iman's murderer is said to be the same as the suspect who took Zainab's life.,Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif on Tuesday had addressed a press conference in Lahore to formally , in the Zainab rape and murder case. The suspect, based in Kasur, is accused of being a serial killer who raped and murdered seven girls over the course of two years — Iman being one of them.,The DNA of the suspect arrested following Zainab's murder has also matched the samples collected from the crime scene of Iman's murder, Dr Muhammad Ashraf Tahir, director general of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA), told , on Thursday.,A total of 171 DNA samples, including Mudassir's, had been collected after Iman's murder, however, Mudassir's DNA had not matched samples gathered from the crime scene. ,According to the forensics report, it was the alleged killer of Zainab who had also sexually assaulted Iman before murdering her.,Iman's father while talking to , on Wednesday said he was called by police to hear Mudassir confess to his daughter's murder at the time. And while he said Mudassir confessed to the crime back then, he now believes Mudassir was ""killed wrongly"" after emergence of DNA data in Zainab's case. ,Mudassir's case was first reported by the , last week after a , that Iman's killer was the same as the one behind Zainab's murder. ,A senior police officer had told the , that after Mudassir was taken into custody, he confessed to killing Iman before he was shot dead while ""trying to escape"".,Mudasir's family, however, told , they believed police knew he wasn't the killer but killed him extrajudicially because they had been unable to trace the real culprit. ,While talking to ,, the family said Mudassir was taken away on the same evening Iman was murdered; they claimed that no DNA test had been conducted before Mudassir was killed. ,Kasur police officials told the , that Iman's five-year-old cousin Adeel, who she was reportedly playing with when abducted, had identified Mudasir as the suspect.,But Mudassir's family say they await justice over his death to this day. ,""I feel as if I have lost everything. They killed my son,"" his mother told the ,. She said her family had to move out of Kasur after they were treated as pariahs by the neighbours following Iman's murder. ,When confronted with the revelations, Punjab government spokesman Malik Ahmad Khan told the , an inquiry would be held to determine any violations and those responsible for any ""extrajudicial killing won't be spared"".,In a separate development, it has emerged that the murder of a four-year-old Mardan girl earlier this month would have been solved by now if the Forensic Science Laboratory in Peshawar had been functional, officials told ,.,The child was found murdered in a sugarcane field near her house in Mardan on January 14. Local authorities and doctors claimed that the toddler was assaulted before she was strangled to death. ,The DNA samples gathered from the crime scene were sent to PFSA lab in Lahore and KP police are still awaiting results of the test, which take around 10-15 days to be finalised.,The only forensic lab in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa established in 2014 still remains non-functional due to lack of DNA testing kits. The government had paid $21,000 to a private company, H.A Shah and Sons — the only DNA testing kits suppliers in Pakistan — for 600 testing kits that were never received. ,The company now claims that all its supplies, that are imported, had been purchased by the Punjab government for investigating the Zainab murder case."

831,2018-01-25,Action after Kasur,"A SUSPECT has been apprehended, now it is time for justice to take its course. ,The Kasur tragedy has shocked the nation, opened a necessary national dialogue on the terrible scourge of child sexual assault and perhaps helped pave a path to social and state reform. ,The authorities in Punjab, including Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif in a rather distasteful, triumphant news conference on Tuesday, have announced the arrest of a suspect in the case of sexual assault and murder of young Zainab Amin. ,The suspect, Imran Ali, is also believed to be responsible for the assault and murder of other young children, and yesterday he was presented in an anti-terrorism court. ,Investigators have an initial 14 days to assemble the evidence against the suspected killer. ,DNA test results could be the irrefutable proof that connects him to the horrific crimes he is accused of having committed, but it is necessary that all aspects of the investigation be conducted professionally and with scrupulous adherence to the rules and laid-down procedure.,While the intense national scrutiny on the case is unlikely to fade entirely, too often poorly conducted investigations have allowed defendants to escape conviction, have a conviction overturned on appeal or the sentence reduced. ,If Imran Ali is guilty of the grotesque crimes he is accused of, the law must take its course. ,This newspaper has on principle opposed the death penalty in all instances and there is no rational reason to deviate from principles in this case. ,Assaulting children and murdering them is a particularly shocking crime and there has rightly been a national uproar over what appears to be a serial killer who has destroyed a number of families. ,Such threats to society do not deserve to be allowed their freedom, possibly forever if the rules allow it and the convict continues to be professionally assessed to be a threat. ,What is troubling though is how many segments of society have demanded a public execution of the alleged serial killer. ,A bloodlust appears to have overcome society, perhaps an indication of a public that does not feel safe and does not believe the state has the ability to regularly and consistently protect the people.,Justice as vengeance may satisfy the mediaeval instincts of some, but the state cannot become part of a spectacle of death before cheering crowds. ,The right lesson to be drawn from this harrowing episode of assault and killing, even if it is drowned out by emotions, is for the state to examine the multiple failures that allow a serial killer to carry out his monstrous crimes undetected for long and for society to understand what steps need to be taken to better protect children from the threat of predators. ,The Kasur tragedy can become a watershed moment, but there needs to be a comprehensive understanding of what went wrong and a determination to address the faults."
832,2018-01-25,Vengeance is not justice,"			
,NOW that an arrest has been made in the gruesome case of the horrific murder of little Zainab of Kasur, it is disturbing to see calls mounting for a ‘public hanging’. At the very outset, mobs protesting the crime in Kasur, and outside the DHQ hospital, demanded ‘public flogging and hanging’ of the murderer. Then a few journalists endorsed the idea publicly. ,Senator Rehman Malik, a former interior minister, introduced an amendment to the law in the Senate Subcommittee on Interior that he heads, to make possible public executions in cases of violent crime against children. The amendment passed and moved to the house, where similar calls have been raised by other lawmakers. Most recently, Chief Minister Punjab Shahbaz Sharif also made the same call during the news conference where he announced that an arrest had been made in the case on the basis of a DNA match.,Let’s get one thing straight. I fully understand the sentiments of those who are making such a demand, and have had to restrain my own visceral impulses when following this case. But it is important to point out how deeply flawed and misguided such sentiment is, especially when dealing with a serial killer, and, yes, the police have said that the killer in Zainab’s case is a serial killer whose DNA was found on six other victims, all young girls. ,‘Hanging people publicly will not deter such crimes in the future.’,Serial killers are not deterred by violent punishment, nor are they apprehended through normal investigative means. And the worst way to deal with such criminals is to execute them extrajudicially like what probably happened to Javed Iqbal, a serial killer from more than a decade ago who claimed over 100 victims, mostly children. ,The reason is that to be able to catch a serial killer, and they exist in every population, one needs special tools. The FBI has a special department only to hunt and track down serial killers, because the detective work required for their apprehension is different from normal policing.,To get a better idea of what is required in such cases, I reached out to Dr Ali Hashmi from the Department of Psychiatry at King Edward Medical University, Lahore. The police availed themselves of the services of this department during their investigation in the Zainab case, and Dr Hashmi has also publicly taken a strong stand against a public hanging. ,“[T]hese incessant calls for revenge by baying for a public hanging are totally insane!” he tweeted recently. “Hanging people publicly will not deter such crimes in the future. It will only further brutalise an already brutalised society and may make such crimes more likely.” He followed up by underlining the importance of psychological profiling of such criminals and maintaining a database.,“There are similarities in criminal behaviour,” Dr Hashmi told me when I spoke with him on the phone. I asked him what a psychiatrist would look for when building such a profile. “You study the morphology of the crime, the time of day, location, how the victim was induced to follow the attacker and other such things, as well as the background of the criminal, such as early life, childhood, schooling, family relationships, sexual history and so on. After that we would get into the specifics, such as how the killer chose the victim and the location where to take them and so on” for the purposes of the crime.,“If you build a proper psychological profile, it will give you clues about where to guide your investigation; of course, it won’t lead you straight to the killer, but it will help. You can also build a picture of the kind of person who is more likely to commit such a crime in the future.”,There is another advantage of such profiles, after the killer has been identified and apprehended (which, let us admit, has not yet happened in the present case. We only have an accused at this point, and every accused is entitled to a fair trial and an opportunity to defend himself or herself, even those accused of child molestation and serial killers). The other advantage is that building a psychological profile begins during the investigation, long before the actual apprehension, because it yields clues about the future course of action, and provides opportunities to ensnare the criminal.,“A year ago we discovered in Sargodha that children were being abducted and murdered,” Dr Hashmi told me. “Clues from there can help. In this case [Kasur] they had no database, they were going door to door, speaking to thousands of people” in order to track down the killer. Such a high-intensity dragnet was possible in this case only because of its massive public profile, but it is not practical to do this in all cases involving serial killers or other criminals acting on deranged impulses. ,The baying for blood must stop. Senator Rehman Malik should withdraw his amendment calling for the law to be changed to allow ‘public hangings’ of criminals whose victims are children, and Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif should not offer further promises of a public spectacle. Instead, the political leadership should ask law enforcement, and other professionals involved in the apprehension of such cases, what resources they require in order to streamline their efforts and sharpen their investigations. Dr Hashmi has advised the building of a database of psychological profiles of all such killers — and there are lots of them — much like a fingerprint or DNA database.,The general public can be excused for succumbing to reflex, and confusing vengeance with justice. But thought and opinion leaders, as well as the political leadership, must not pander to such sentiments. The calls for visible punishment help slake the bodily thirst for retribution, but will do nothing to protect the millions of other children in our society, as well as future generations, from those who stalk them with criminal intent. , "

839,2018-01-26,Raza Khan: The vanishing act,"			
,Pakistan has a problem with peaceniks. Because the country is at war — sometimes with others, often with itself. And those advocating peace are dangerous because they question the logic of war. The dangerous then disappear. Lahore-based activist Raza Khan is one of them. He is the convener of Aaghaz-e-Dosti, a friendship initiative between the youth of India and Pakistan. On December 2, the 40-year-old attended a meeting at another initiative he is part of: Lowkey Lokai, which holds dialogue and debates on issues critical to a peaceful society. That was the last time he was heard from or seen. Since then, Raza has been ‘missing’, with unconfirmed reports stating that he was picked up by plain-clothes men from his Model Colony residence. His family believes Raza is being unlawfully detained. Their counsel says they fear that intelligence agencies are responsible for his disappearance.,Raza has been a vocal opponent of state suppression. Friends attending the forum he spoke at on the night he went missing remember Raza being critical of the military. The security establishment does not take kindly to those taking such liberties. Liberals like Raza advocate the need for conversation. They champion diversity and call for shunning conformity. But that requires introspection. Imposing is easier. “Scarcely does a week go by without Amnesty International receiving reports of people going missing in Pakistan,” Amnesty International’s Deputy South Asia Director Dinushika Dissanayake said in a statement urging authorities to take immediate steps towards Raza’s safe recovery. ,Sadly, his disappearance will be neither the first nor last.,In the beginning of 2017, five bloggers went ‘missing’. Over time, four of them returned. The whereabouts of Samar Abbas, president of the Civil Progressive Alliance Pakistan, remain unknown to this day. Ironically, those who wrote about people going missing have become the story themselves. A young female journalist, Zeenat Shahzadi, went missing from Lahore in 2015 for two years. She was reporting on the disappearance of an Indian citizen, Hamid Ansari, who reportedly came to Pakistan after befriending a Pakistani woman on the Internet. His disappearance, however, was reported to have happened because he was a spy — allegedly. Then there are Baloch students who have gone missing from Karachi. One, SagheerAhmed Baloch, was picked up from Karachi University on November 20 this year. The same month, four other Baloch students were taken away by security personnel during a raid on a house in Karachi while another was picked up from his own residence in the same city.,Where do these men and women go when they go missing? Their abductors have never been identified. The police feign ignorance, but are still hesitant to register cases. The judiciary, the parliament and the commission on enforced disappearances censure law enforcement agencies to little effect. Sometimes, as was the case with the ‘Adiala 11’, people disappear even when they are cleared by the courts — that too from prison! The deep state has its deep prisons.,Meanwhile, Raza’s family waits for his return, not knowing if he is even alive. Not knowing if it is better to speak or suffer in silence. Not knowing what would provoke his captors to keep him captive, or worse. For the loved ones of all those who have gone missing, time is a cruel friend. It both gives and takes away hope. The wait is painful and uncertain. The plea is always the same: if their loved ones have broken the law, they should be tried and punished. If not, they should be freed. But Pakistan, it seems, has a problem with freedom too. "

He regretted that the Kasur incident was being discussed all over the world. ,He raised concerns about the security of the suspect, saying he feared attempts might be made on his life in police custody and requested the court to hand over the suspect to other institutions. ,The chief justice also conceded that the safety and security of the suspect was of great importance at this juncture, but rejected the idea of shifting the suspect from police custody. ,The court asked the anchorperson to provide the list of bank accounts of the suspect as well as the transcript of his TV programme. It directed the Punjab government, IGP and the joint investigation team (JIT) to submit a comprehensive reply to the allegations levelled by the anchorperson. ,Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan asked Dr Masood to provide any other information he might have in his possession. ,The case will be taken up on Monday (Jan 29). ,A senior official told Dawn that the Punjab government had requested the State Bank to assist it in identifying whether there was any truth that suspect Imran held foreign currency accounts. ,“The JIT has requested State Bank governor to provide information about all bank accounts held and all transactions made by suspect Imran,” the official said. ,Following Dr Masood’s programme, rumours were rife that the government had started quizzing senior government officials as well as MNAs and MPAs over links with Imran and the international pornography ring. However, a senior official said these were just rumours. ,Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah also brushed aside the anchorperson’s claims and demanded that he [Dr Masood] be banned from appearing on TV shows if his revelations were proved wrong. ,The Federal Investigation Agency also launched its probe into the alleged foreign currency accounts of the suspect and his alleged links with the pornography network. ,Meanwhile, a Punjab police spokesman said the Kasur JIT members had begun regular interrogation of the suspect following his 14-day physical remand obtained from a special court. He said all aspects of the case were being observed through modern and scientific means, besides getting information about other incidents of sexual abuse. ,“The JIT members have met the heirs of two other girl victims, but could not meet the father of Zainab as he was not well,” the spokesman said, adding that another meeting was scheduled with Zainab’s father. ,The spokesman said the JIT had also called Dr Masood and asked him to appear before it and explain all evidences about the Kasur incident disclosed by him in his programme. ,Meanwhile, a WhatsApp message is circulating alleging an MNA from Kasur is the kingpin of Kasur porn industry. The message claims that the politician was allegedly involved in smuggling child porn videos to India through the Hussainiwala Kasur-Gandasingwala sector."

867,2018-01-29,How Mashal Khan became Herald's Person of the Year 2017,"			
,He called himself a humanist. A 23-year-old journalism student from a village in Swabi who only wanted to make a difference. He often discussed religion, politics and society openly. His candid social media commentary over controversial topics sparked major discussions. In his free time, he wrote poetry in Pashto. He had many people thinking about society’s deeper, darker and untouched demons — and this upset many. It was not very long before some started seeing his views as weapons of defiance and opposition against the system. On his Facebook profile, his favourite quote reads: “I’m at peace with God. My conflict is with men.”,Little did he know he would be accused of blasphemy by his fellow students when he showed up for class at Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan on April 13, 2017. ,He sent a text message to his friend: ,“They are falsely saying that I insulted the Prophet.”,His friend replied: “Now, what’s happening?”,There was no response from Mashal Khan.,His friend asked again: “Where are you?”,Still no response.,Mashal Khan was brutally assaulted inside the university premises by an angry mob later that day. His attackers included many of his classmates. They found him hidden in his dorm room before they beat him up and killed him. The very dorm room whose walls he had used as a canvas to express his thoughts. One of the notes he had scribbled there read: “Because being different means you make a difference.”,That was his fault: he was different. ,			
,Even though there are several common elements in incidents involving blasphemy, the specific details of each episode vary. What distinguished Mashal Khan’s case is that his violent murder for a sin he did not commit ignited a flame in our hearts, a flame of anguish over injustices committed in the name of faith, a flame for a desire to change it all. ,On a lesser level, he has us all – well, almost all – voting for him as the , Person of the Year 2017. Similar to our Person of the Year in 2014 and 2015, here again we find ourselves voting for another victim, another casualty. Except this time the victim was falsely accused of blasphemy and was not a fatality of a terrorist act. ,“They were happy. They were very happy when they were beating him,” Mashal Khan’s best friend, Faheem Alam Khan, says in the 2017 BBC Documentary ,. Faheem describes how charged the crowd was while beating up someone they thought was an atheist, an agnostic. When asked if Mashal Khan ever thought of keeping his thoughts and opinions to himself, Faheem replied that he did so several times but could not check himself. “He was outspoken!”,			
,Why should we be stunned at this violence disguised as virtue? ,After all, the path to Mashal Khan’s murder is dotted with many a milestone indicating where we have ultimately been led: a Christian convert from Islam, Tahir Iqbal, was found dead in jail in 1992 after being accused of abusing the Prophet of Islam; Hafiz Farooq Sajjad was stoned to death after a Quran in his house caught fire in 1994; in 1997, Justice Arif Iqbal Bhatti was assassinated for exonerating Salamat Masih, a Christian who was accussed of blasphemy when he was about 12 years old; Muhammad Yousuf Ali was shot dead in Lahore prison in 2002 where he was serving his sentence for supposedly committing blasphemy; Samuel Masih, who was in police custody over blasphemy charges, was hammered  to death by a police officer in 2003 who claimed it was his duty as a Muslim to kill someone who had blasphemed; in 2011, Punjab governor Salman Taseer was assassinated by his bodyguard for voicing his opinion on the blasphemy law and supporting Asia Bibi, a convict under that law. ,These are just some of the many incidents that shook us all to the core. And yet they happen again and again. ,			
,This recurrence makes Mashal Khan’s assassination all the more significant. If we have not learned to mend our collective ways after his murder, when will we ever? If his lynching for something he did not even commit does not change our thinking, what will? ,Mashal Khan is the , Person of the Year in 2017, signifying both our rage at our own failure to rectify our behaviour and our protest at how the laws of the land are constantly misused and abused with impunity in the name of religion to suppress differences of opinion.,			
,Our Person of the Year segment is neither a popularity contest nor is it an alternate to national elections. It is just a measure of how much news coverage various individuals and issues get in a calendar year.,This is not to undermine the fact that, at the end of the day, people see what they want to see. And that explains why we have put in place an elaborate process to finalise our Person of the Year. It starts with a negative selection in which many nominees get eliminated because there cannot be more than ten of them.,The conversation begins in early September, when the , editorial staff start to nominate their candidates. These suggestions and many others, randomly chosen from media coverage, are then brought together in an all-staff meeting. This past year we heard passionate cases for Maryam Nawaz, Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy and everyone in between. ,An online poll is another important part of the process, though it is decidedly limited in its coverage since it is mostly taken by English-reading audiences of the various online platforms of the Dawn Media Group, including the Herald. Sometimes, the respondents include a large number of expatriates and even foreigners. They are also predominantly urban males. ,To make up for some of these problems, we have a panel of 10 eminent Pakistanis who bring in authoritative voices and lend intellectual weight to the selection process. They include people from different genders, areas and professions.,To make the process even more representative and inclusive, this time around we carried out a public opinion survey across Pakistan on the basis of a demographic sample stratified at four levels: province, gender, mother language and location. The sample, consisting of more than 1,500 Pakistanis, was derived from the latest available official data (collected in the 2017 census) and its field work was carried out by a large team of surveyors in 36 districts in early December. ,The ground survey made it apparent that, for most Pakistanis, politics remains the biggest news story and politicians the biggest news makers. Three people who together won more than 75 per cent of votes – Imran Khan, Nawaz Sharif and Justice Asif Saeed Khosa – represent most of the various shades of Pakistan’s politics in 2017.,Hardly anyone voted for the bloggers who went missing in January 2017. Perhaps just a few remembered what happened to them by the year’s end. Even Mashal Khan received only about six per cent of the ground survey votes. The census worker, who represented perhaps the largest government campaign in recent years, also did not register on the radar of most respondents.,			
,Mohsin Hamid, Najam Sethi and Ayesha Gulalai are some other nominees who together garnered roughly seven per cent of votes (as compared to Mahira Khan who alone received 6.52 per cent of votes). Hamid was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize 2017 and has received international acclaim for his books but those voting in our field surveys do not see him anywhere among the top news makers in 2017. The same goes for Ayesha Gulalai, who was reviled profusely on social media both before and after we posted our Person of the Year nominees for our online survey. Even Najam Sethi, who is a well-recognised cricket manager, has failed to make the cut in an otherwise cricket-crazy country.,Earlier this year, when five activist bloggers went missing, a hateful campaign was waged against them that accused them of blasphemy. None of them were taken to court. They were, instead, taken away by security officials to unknown destinations. A court in Islamabad was recently told that they had committed no blasphemy but the damage to their reputation had been done.,Four of them have already left Pakistan. Others are lying low for understandable reasons of personal safety. In a year that started with their disappearance and culminated in a frenzied mob’s siege of Islamabad, they are not the only ones feeling insecure."
868,2018-01-29,Zainab’s murder: how will the prosecution build its case?,"The Punjab government may rely on a plethora of evidence for its prosecution against the suspect in Zainab Amin’s rape and murder case, but they should be wary of the fact that they cannot rely solely on DNA evidence, let alone any single form of evidence, for conviction. ,In fact, corroboration of different kinds of evidence — medical, physical and ocular — will be needed to convict the suspect, and the state’s competence will be tested on a heightened level.   ,The Punjab government missed a key opportunity to enact tailor-made legislation for rape cases when, in a public interest jurisdiction matter (,), a series of suggestions and guidelines were proposed to Punjab by the supreme court on how the police, hospitals and doctors should handle cases of rape. ,While the suggestions primarily related to protecting the victim from the accused during all stages of investigation and trial, it included guidelines which could have safeguarded the government’s interests as well. , ,This included the mandatory administration of DNA tests and preservation of DNA evidence in rape cases, along with separate screens for vulnerable witnesses so that they do not have to face the accused persons during trial. ,The then prosecutor-general of Punjab had said that legislation was likely to be made in this regard. Regrettably, no such legislation has been enacted in the province yet. Therefore, the Punjab government will have to rely on existing laws to convict the suspect in Zainab’s case.  ,Since there is no direct evidence in this case due to the victim being deceased and there being no known, direct witnesses to the crimes, the prosecution will have to rely on a string of other forms of evidence to connect the suspect with the offence without any reasonable doubt.,Persons directly involved with the investigation of the case will serve as crucial evidence against the suspect. The Medico Legal Officer (MLO) who conducted Zainab’s post-mortem examination will be called upon to verify the contents of the examination report, along with the chain of events leading to the issuance of the report. ,Similarly, the police team (e.g., the investigating officer) that seized the physical evidence in the commission of the crime (e.g., the suspect’s jacket) will be called upon as witnesses. ,The MLO and the investigative team will be subject to extensive cross-examination on when, where and how they obtained and preserved their evidence and/or findings. ,Any substantial disparity discovered in or between the investigation and the post-mortem report, including any major contradictions in the recollection of the events or any improper collection/preservation of the evidence, will severely taint the prosecution’s case.,While there might not be direct witnesses to the commission of the crimes against Zainab, witnesses of interest, including those who may have seen or observed the suspect before or after the crimes, will be called upon to narrate relevant facts as circumstantial evidence. ,Different witnesses’ narrations will be compared and contrasted to determine the sequence of events leading up to the commission of the crime and after. ,The consistency amongst the witnesses’ testimonies and any presence or absence of preconceived animosity/ill-will against the accused will play an integral role in determining the veracity of their statements. ,The prosecution, and consequently the state, will have to be especially wary of out-of-court intimidation tactics by the suspect or other vested parties. ,Such tactics have notoriously adversely impacted trials of rape, whereby eyewitnesses often change or resile from their statements due to intimidation tactics employed against them. , ,Overwhelming and irrefutable evidence of the above (i.e., medical, physical and ocular evidence) may be strong enough to convict the suspect. ,However, any significant discrepancy in the above will force the prosecution to rely on forensic evidence, including DNA, as additional corroborative evidence.   ,The aforementioned 2013 supreme court judgment held that DNA evidence, while not conclusive on its own, could be considered as valid evidence in corroboration with other pieces of evidence. ,In 2015, however, the supreme court, in the context of a biochemist’s DNA report in a kidnapping and murder case, held that DNA evidence was not admissible due to the fact that there was no sanction of law regarding the admission of such. ,While this may have created some ambiguity on the relevance of DNA evidence in rape cases, the federal legislature in 2016 passed the ,, which amended Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by adding that samples of DNA, where practicable, shall be collected and sent for examination at the earliest.,Therefore, the Punjab government may introduce DNA evidence in Zainab’s case. However, the mere availability of such evidence will not tantamount to admission or acceptance of it, as the forensic/DNA expert will also be subject to cross-examination and scrutiny. ,While DNA evidence can serve as a powerful evidentiary device, it can become contaminated or corrupted by errors in laboratories from factors such as coincidental matches, time, temperature, contact with other contaminants, and exposure to other elements. ,The forensic expert will have to back the collection, preservation and findings meticulously before the court of law.  ,: ,Finally, the accused may at some point argue that he made an extra-judicial confession, which is a confession made out of court, and not as a part of a judicial examination or investigation. ,Such a confession would need to be corroborated by other evidence by the prosecution, or else it would be insufficient to warrant a conviction, especially if the confession was made before a person of influence and authority. ,Such evidence can at best be corroborating evidence, and is held to be the weakest type of evidence and no conviction on can be made on such evidence by itself.,The prosecution's case hinges on narrating an unbroken chain of corroborative pieces and links of evidence against the suspect. If the circumstantial evidence connects the accused with the offence without any reasonable doubt, it will form the basis for the accused’s capital punishment."
869,2018-01-29,Sindh government suspends Rao Anwar,"The Sindh government on Monday finally placed former SSP Malir Rao Anwar Ahmed Khan, who has been absconding in the extrajudicial killing case of 27-year-old aspiring model Naqeebullah Mehsud, under suspension from official duty. ,“With the approval of chief minister Sindh, the services of former SSP Malir district, Anwar Ahmed and former SP Investigation-II, East Zone, Muhammad Altaf Sarwar Malik are placed under suspension with immediate effect,” a notification issued by the chief secretary, Sindh, read.,It added that the headquarters of the said police officers during the period of their suspension shall be at Central Police Office, Karachi, and that: “They shall draw pay and allowances during the period of their suspension as admissible under the rules.”,Meanwhile, Additional IGP Sindh Counter-Terrorism Department Dr Sanaullah Abbasi told , that everything possible would be done to ensure the arrest of Anwar in accordance with the Supreme Court's order.,Abbasi pointed out that several teams have been formed to implement the apex court's order, and opined that ""organizations are more important than individuals."",The notification came after much deliberation from the PPP-led Sindh government, despite , of the Sindh Inspector General of Police, A.D. Khowaja, communicated much earlier in this regard.,Anwar and his team are accused of staging on January 13 a fake 'encounter', during which Mehsud, a 27-year-old hailing from South Waziristan, and three others were killed.,Initially, Anwar had maintained that the slain quartet were members of a militant organisations but an investigation team found no evidence to their claim, ruling their killing as a fake 'encounter'.,Anwar has since made a botched attempt to flee the country before going into hiding. ,Following ,, the Supreme Court has also , of the matter.

880,2018-01-31,Committee set up to seek suggestions for quick conviction of street criminals in Sindh,"KARACHI: The Sindh government has set up a committee of legal experts and security specialists to seek suggestions for speedy trial and to ensure conviction of suspected street criminals, who are frequently arrested but manage to come out of prison without facing any serious punishment, a senior official told Dawn on Tuesday. ,He said that on the orders of Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, a committee led by the advocate general had been set up which would recommend measures to the provincial government for speedy trials of street crime suspects. ,The recent move is the result of law enforcement agencies’ recommendations to register cases against street criminals on terrorism charges to eliminate the menace. ,“The members of the committee include prosecutor general, home secretary, law secretary and senior police officials,” he added. ,“The committee will convene its meeting soon to set the course of its task. One can expect that after deliberations and discussion, the committee will be able to recommend practical measures to achieve the target. ,“It’s expected that the committee will focus on different options, including dedicating certain courts for prosecution of street crime suspects and amendment to the law to ensure conviction of street crime suspects,” he said. ,The official added that the provincial government decided to seek proposal from its legal team following pressure from political opponents and civil society amid rise in street crimes as the conviction rate of alleged criminals remained too low. ,“Law experts have, however, suggested that such a move could not stand in the court of law,” said the official. ,“During preparation of the proposal, police authorities argued in favour of applying the anti-terror law against street crime suspects, saying that such armed men in fact cause panic and fear in society.” ,However, the legal experts, he said, did not agree with the argument, declaring it weak. ,“In case of an FIR registered under sections of the anti-terror law, the prosecution will find it hard to prove it in court, a police officer told us after taking feedback from legal experts,” added the official. ,Despite a significant decline in other criminal activities, including targeted killing on ethnic, sectarian and political grounds, and terrorism-related incidents amid Rangers-led operations in the city, street crimes remain a challenge for law-enforcement agencies. ,In 2016, when the city witnessed a significant drop in major criminal activities, robberies and incidents of theft, snatching of motorcycles and mobile phones, which are key indicators, street crimes witnessed a sudden rise when compared with the 2015 crime data. ,The Citizens-Police Liaison Committee (CPLC) crime data of the past two years says that incidents of motorcycle theft increased by 25 per cent in 2016 as compared to 2015, though motorcycle snatching incidents had dropped by 15pc during the same period. ,Similarly, mobile phone snatching incidents had increased by 10pc in 2016 as compared to 2015. ,The official data of registered crimes provided by the Karachi police and the CPLC shows the failure of authorities to check street crimes while throwing into question the very effectiveness of the ongoing targeted operations, which have completed their fourth year in the metropolis. ,The authorities argue that it is not only the capability of the police force and effective strategy on the part of law-enforcement agencies, but there are other elements as well which are missing from a forceful fight against the street crimes. ,“The fresh move seeking suggestion from the legal experts is part of that strategy which government wants to devise against the menace. ,“The suggestion to introduce anti-terror charges against the suspects was made in the same spirit, but we couldn’t make it,” the official concluded."

885,2018-01-31,Deadly proposals,"			
,SHE had come home for vacations. Asma Rani, a medical student, was studying at a medical college in Abbottabad. She was in her third year, only two years shy of becoming a full-fledged doctor. In pictures, she smiles at the camera, shy but also confident and completely unaware of the horror that would define her last moments.,Those last moments, captured on video and played on social media screens, are terrifying ones. In them, the young and dying Asma Rani, who has just been shot, says the name of her murderer, Mujahid Afridi. It takes everything she has left. ,We know that Asma Rani, shot because she did not accept a marriage proposal, would not live for much longer after the video was made. ,, like the lives of so many other young girls in Pakistan, simply because she did not bow to the wishes of a man. ,Few pause to consider the culpability of a society that collectively believes in male entitlement.,Within a day, her body lay in front of a male-only gathering in Lakki Marwat, her ancestral village, and she was buried.  ,According to reports that are routinely issued after such a crime is committed, police began to carry out raids in the area soon after the murder. These raids, however, were utterly useless. Asma’s assailant, Mujahid Afridi, reportedly a relative of a local leader of the PTI, had fled. ,Some local people maintained that Afridi went to the Gulf, where he has business interests. Police officials have since revealed that he has fled to Saudi Arabia. There was no information at the time of writing regarding any efforts to locate him within that country or if any Saudi officials had been contacted. When police routinely avoid catching the killers of women, even those who are actually in Pakistan, one doubts that any efforts will be made to arrest the killers that have fled the country. ,Indeed, if convictions are any evidence of beliefs and truths, killing a woman is not a crime in Pakistan. Before Asma Rani was killed with such impunity in front of her sister-in-law, allowed to die at the hands of a man who believed he was entitled to marry her, to punish her for her refusal, there have been others, even in Kohat, the small town where the crime happened. ,Almost exactly one year ago, an M.Phil. graduate named ,. Shahnawaz, who worked with an NGO, supported her widowed mother and her sister-in-law who lived with them after the death of her brother. Her killer was a cousin named Mehboob Alam, who, like Mujahid Afridi, immediately fled the scene. His gripe? The fact that Hina had rejected his marriage proposal and that she dared to work outside the home. ,d, but this was an aberration in such cases. Scores of others get away scot-free.,Two years, then, two murders, and two women who were silenced, their potential and their future erased by men raised by society to believe that women could never say no to them. Even while the airwaves and newspapers of the country have been rife with outrage over the death of an innocent young girl, few have paused to consider the culpability of a society that collectively promotes and believes in male entitlement. ,It is this last bit, about male entitlement, via which the males of the nation believe that no one, especially no woman, can ever say no to them for anything, that undergirds all the acts of criminality being carried out against women and children. ,Despite the gruesome and chilling nature of Asma Rani’s murder, the terrifying video of what were her last moments, it is undoubted that many will blame the victim: a girl who goes away to study in another city, a girl who says no to a man, is, in Pakistan, a girl who is ‘asking for it’, who is guilty. Asma Rani and Hina Shahnawaz were killed, but those who manage to live also suffer, the living dead of a society that does not believe in their right to have choices, in their right to say no.,So, as with Zainab and Hina and so many others and the many more that will perish, no justice is expected. The police will posture, the politicians will pander and nothing will change. One resolution “condemning the killing” has already been passed in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly; a few more may be passed. False assurances will be given, and some men will pretend that they feel bad about this, the latest in Pakistan’s War on Women. Nothing significant, nothing really substantial and nothing having the potential to deliver justice, to make an example out of the culprits, will take place. ,In the Pakistan of 2018, hope for change is hard to find. It is hardly ever the killers of women who are made into examples, with no punishment meted out to them and no public shaming of them as a message to other men who cannot tolerate women who say no. Instead, it is always women, forever women, who pay for a society that has no room for their voices or for their volition. ,While the world is in the throes of movements that shame men who exploit and harass and humiliate women, Pakistan continues to insist on their lesser humanity, the denial of their dignity. Asma Rani died for this. In any other country this would be a tragedy; in Pakistan it is routine, just the way things are, the way men want them to be. ,

889,2018-01-31,Naqeebullah murder: The 'encounter' that ended Pakistan's passivity over extra-judicial killings,"The killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud has unleashed festering anger at a rash of alleged extrajudicial murders and the police accused of orchestrating them.,Hundreds of people die each year at the hands of law enforcement officers under pressure to crack down on kidnapping, murder and gang crime in a city routinely ranked among the most dangerous in the world.,But the fatal shooting of 23-year-old Mehsud, an aspiring model whose goofy dance videos and airbrushed brown locks had earned him a large Facebook following, brought thousands of people onto the streets to urge an end to impunity.,“We demand that his killer be hanged publicly,” said Mohammad Khan Mehsud of a national outcry over his son's death.
“We saw people from all the four provinces (of Pakistan) — men and women, kids, youngsters and sisters — show solidarity with him”.,			
,Mehsud was shot dead along with three other people in what police say was an operation targeting Taliban insurgents on January 3rd.,Friends and relatives insist the internet celebrity had no connection to militancy.,They say he was the victim of a so-called “encounter killing” — an “encounter” being police shorthand for when a suspect resists arrest.,Such deaths have surged in Karachi since 2013 when the army and police launched a massive “clean up” operation targeting Taliban militants, organised crime networks and armed political muscle.,In its wake, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) said there were at least 598 extrajudicial killings in 2014 and an additional 343 the following year.,A preliminary investigation headed by Sanaullah Abbasi, chief of Karachi's Counter Terrorism Department, said the encounter involving Mehsud was probably staged.,“We have interviewed some militants (purportedly linked with the case) in jail and inspected the scene of crime that seemed to be very doubtful,” Abbasi told AFP. “Prima facie, it was a fake encounter.” ,Much of the anger following the social media star's death has focused on Rao Anwar, senior superintendent of the Karachi police force.,			
,Anwar, who rose through the force's battle-hardened ranks in the 1990s, has been accused of spearheading hundreds of killings including that of Mehsud.,Last week a Karachi lawyer filed a petition in the Sindh High Court, listing 250 allegedly fake encounters involving Anwar since 1992.,The police officer has also been added to a travel ban after trying to flee the country.,He has missed successive court summonses and is now believed to be on the run, according to a senior police official familiar with the case.,Yet as anger grows against him, experts warn that the campaign is not the work of a few bad cops, but rather the result of institutional shortcomings in the sprawling and violent megacity.,Long before Anwar, bullet-riddled bodies were being dumped in barren neighbourhoods as police with little faith in the courts took on dangerous armed political factions and often heavily-armed insurgents.,			
,“The investigation procedures are archaic,” said Asad Iqbal Butt, director of HRCP. “So they (police) are left with only one option... pick a guy, hang him, beat him and if he survives that is his fate and if he dies, just dump him in the bushes.” ,The rise in encounter killings accompanying the clean-up offensive has coincided with a drop in violent crime — with instances of kidnapping, murder and terrorism all dramatically down.,“It is good that crimes and violence have come down in the city as police and rangers have been killing the terrorists and criminals. But common and innocent people must be not the victims,” said Umeed Ali, an auto rickshaw driver in Karachi.,Rehmat Khan, a retired senior police officer, said that in developed countries, “encounter” killings were rare.
“Here it takes place because we are incompetent professionally, we look for short cuts.“"

902,2018-02-01,Three online child pornography cases unearthed in Punjab,"LAHORE: Even as the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has been able to track down three men who are allegedly involved in uploading and selling child pornographic content online, the agency has proposed the setting up of a fully equipped ‘cyber patrol wing’ at its headquarters to unearth other such cases in the country. ,At the moment, there is no team at any FIA office that’s working full time to track down the suspects involved in selling or uploading pornographic material online. The FIA goes after suspects on the basis of tip-offs or complaints. ,Three cases involving child pornography have surfaced in the country since the cybercrime wing of the FIA was set up a few years ago, according to Dr Usman Anwar, the director of the Punjab chapter of FIA. ,“We have so far traced three cases of child pornography either on tip-offs from inside the country or outside of it. We do not have any other mechanism to track down the suspects involved in this heinous crime,” he said. ,“That’s why we have proposed to the federal government that a ‘cyber patrol wing’, comprising a dedicated team of FIA personnel and equipped with the latest software, be set up.” ,FIA proposes ‘cyber patrol wing’ to control such cases,Dr Anwar said an FIA team continuously engaged in ‘patrolling online’ might be able to track down the suspects on its own; otherwise the agency would always be dependent on complaints of people to go after the criminals. ,In response to a question, he said: “The FIA has found cases of child pornography in Sargodha, Fateh Jang and Jhang in which the suspects were involved in selling and sharing child pornographic material online.” ,Taimur Maqsood, a suspect from Jhang, has been accused of exchanging child pornographic content online. Saadat Amin of Sargodha allegedly sold such material online and Nabil of Fateh Jang allegedly made porn videos/pictures of some children. ,In the first two cases, Norwegian and Canadian authorities alerted the FIA to the crimes. And in the third case, the families of five children reported the matter to the agency, said Dr Anwar. ,He said the case involving Amin of Sargodha would likely be decided next month while the case of Nabil of Fateh Jang was still being processed and witnesses were being produced. ,In the case of Maqsood, who has been on physical remand, the FIA has written to banks to collate information about his accounts and investigation is under way. ,Dr Anwar said the FIA had found no evidence, neither in the case of Zainab Amin nor the other child abuse cases of Kasur, of pornographic content online. ,In a letter sent to the federal government, the agency said that extensive research should be carried out to determine how the cyberspace could be made safe for Pakistanis. ,The letter further said the ‘cyber patrol wing’ would help stop transnational high-tech crimes and other illegal activities and thus secure cyber-boundaries of Pakistan. ,“It will also help in monitoring and preventing propagation of terrorism through social media platforms like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook…,” the letter said. ,Meanwhile, after discovery of several child pornography cases in the country, questions are being raised about the lenient sentences allowed in such cases (only seven years’ imprisonment). ,According to the new cybercrime law, Prevention of Electronic Crime Act, “a child pornographer shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of up to seven years or with a fine of up to Rs5 million or with both”. ,When asked if the FIA would want to take steps for enhancing punishment for a pornographer, the FIA director said: “Like the West, we should notify the area people through local police once a convicted pornographer returns to the area after completing his/her sentence.”"

He told the court that the victim was also the son of a deputy superintendent police (DSP) and had slapped the accused first. ,Khosa said there were multiple instances of the SC removing anti-terrorism act (ATA) sections, to which the chief justice had countered that there were also many cases where terrorism sections were added by the apex court. ,On the night of December 24, 2012, 20-year-old Shahzeb Khan, the son of Deputy Superintendent of Police Aurangzeb Khan, was gunned down in Karachi's Defence Housing Authority when he was returning home with his sister from a wedding.,Shahzeb was killed during for picking a fight with one of the suspects’ servants, who had verbally threatened and harassed his sister.,Then chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry had taken suo motu notice of the incident, which sparked widespread outrage across the country through newspapers, TV channels and social media.,As the prime accused belonged to powerful feudal families of Sindh, the incident had triggered a nationwide debate over whether the country’s elite could be held accountable for crimes they committed.,Later, after a speedy trial, Judge Ghulam Mustafa Memon of Anti-Terrorism Court-3 sentenced Shahrukh Jatoi and co-accused Nawab Siraj Talpur to death.

Those who were responsible for providing security are being accused of murder."",The chief justice asked Khowaja what his force was doing when Anwar attempted to flee the country before going into hiding.,""What was the Sindh Police doing?"" he questioned. ""You did not stop Rao Anwar. Should you not have known [his whereabouts]? I had given you 36 hours."" ,""Why did you wait for the victim's father to arrive? The parents were miles away from Karachi, how could they have reached there so soon?

To this, the chief justice asked who the owner of the private jet was.,""The contractor is Ghaus , while the jet's owner is Malik Riaz,"" the DG answered.,The chief justice asked an affidavit statement of Bahria Town CEO Ali Riaz to be submitted in a day or two.,A letter written by Naqeebullah's father was also submitted in the court. ,""Rao Anwar claims on the media that he is in Pakistan,"" the father stated. ""Please ask the police how did he disappear during the investigation."",""The entire Fata awaits justice,"" he added.,To this, the CJP said: ""The people of Fata need not worry.

Some day I will even conduct a hearing in Fata."",Upon Khowaja's request, the Supreme Court directed the intelligence agencies to cooperate with the police and ordered for protection to be arranged for the case's witnesses.,The court gave 10 more days for Anwar arrest, instructing the DG FIA to seek Interpol's services and search for Anwar at all the airports of the world.,The court also forbade the media from broadcasting Anwar's messages on the media.,The case was adjourned until February 13.,Additional Inspector Generals (AIG) of Sindh and Karachi on Thursday briefed a Senate's committee formed for the Mehsud murder case. ,AIG Mushtaq Meher told the committee that six of the 17 suspects have been arrested, while recommendations have been made to put their names on the ECL.,A member of the committee told the police official of Anwar's claim that he is still in Karachi. ""He is in Karachi and you are conducting raids elsewhere,"" the Senator said. To this, the additional IG replied: ""If he is in Karachi then we will catch him there."",AIG Meher admitted the possibility of Anwar fleeing the country illegally by way of Afghanistan exists. At this, PTI MNA Munaza Hassan said: ""You are showing Anwar a way out."",""Rao Anwar himself is the one who shows such ways. No one can show him anything,"" Interior Secretary Sindh, Qazi Shahid, opined.,""Naqeebullah may have left us but his sacrifice has paid dividends. A fake 'encounter' is being investigated for the first time,"" the interior secretary added. "

One of the channels quoted “reliable” sources to claim that the talks between the two sides finally led to an agreement on Diyat but the amount of the blood money was not shared yet. It was also reported that Naqeeb Ullah was represented by the aggrieved family but the identity of those representing Rao Anwar were not ascertained.,However, within the next few minutes Naqeeb Ullah’s family took to social media to clear their position. In a video message, Noor Rahman, a cousin of Naqeeb Ullah, who was quite instrumental in raising voice for his “murder” on social media before the authorities intervened and took notice, rejected all such reports and called them “speculative” and “planted by certain elements to benefit the killers”.,“All such reports are nothing but a bundle of lies,” he said. “The people who do not want justice to prevail must be in favour of such a deal; we are not. I have talked to Naqeeb Ullah’s father, who has categorically denied any dialogue between the two sides. We stand by our demand which is severe punishment to killers of Naqeeb Ullah.”"

Police were trying to make the aggrieved family take back names of the influential suspects nominated in the FIR, he said. ,Saddam Hussain, son of late Karamullah, demanded the government should form a joint investigation team to probe the triple murder and called for immediate arrest of all the suspects. ,Meanwhile, police sources said that one of the seven suspects nominated in the FIR identified as Ali Gohar Chandio had been detained by the Karachi or Hyderabad police.

913,2018-02-02,Where the fake flourish,"			
,ON July 23, 2017, the Kasur correspondent for Dawn reported in a story carried as the lead in the paper’s Lahore Metropolitan section: , — all the deceased minors from ages five to 10, all of them raped and killed. And their bodies found in under-construction houses.,This story, which reported the killing of seven minor girls and three minor boys in Kasur in quick succession, was a whole five months and few days before the world shook in the aftermath of the Zainab murder in Kasur.,That this was the 10th incident of its nature must have been the reason behind the July 2017 story and its prominent placing in the paper. The double figure, it must have been thought, could perhaps shake those concerned into action and could lead to the capture of the ‘serial killer’.,If an investigation has to be undertaken to know why it took the law enforcers so long to get moving in Kasur, it must begin at the place of the crime’s occurrence.,Yes this is what the story said. It did, out of exuberance for it being by any measure a big news story or due to the emerging pattern of the crime, describe it as serial killing. It said “an eight-year-old girl was the 10th victim of this serial killing in the downtown of Kasur since January this year [2017]”.,In those 600-odd words were yet more clues that were crying out to be picked up by an average, overworked, unimaginative police brain. ,The story said: “A-Division police, on July 8, found her body in an under-construction house...” An under construction house, right? This was long before the main suspect, caught after the Zainab murder, was identified as a construction worker. It can be presumed that, if it had registered with the investigator on the job then, the connection could have easily provided direction to the probe.,The construction site and the serial killer profile which were emphasised in the intro to the news story cited here popped up at various points throughout the report... “The serial killing started in January this year,” it was reported, “when a five-year-old girl, of Kot Peeran, was found gagged in an under-construction house. ... In February, the body of a minor girl of Ali Park was found in an under-construction house near her residence.”,Not just that, a journalist based in Kasur recalls that after this 10th incident of minors having been killed, he did actually express his suspicion about there being a possible link between the construction sites and a single perpetrator behind all these murders.,The warnings, the pleas, all went unheard until — according to one version — the picture of young Zainab sent the investigators scurrying around for evidence. The earlier protests couldn’t quite get things moving. (“After every killing, the public would resort to road protests and disperse after police’s assurance that the case would be resolved soon,” said the July 2017 story.),This wasn’t all. To add more grimness and a sense of urgency to the message, the July 2017 newspaper flash referred to a recent incident that had highlighted the dangers lurking around the vulnerably young in Kasur. Yes, there was this essential mention of the “Husain Khanwala incident in which hundreds of children were abused, filmed and, later, blackmailed by local gangs some two years back”. Yet there was nothing which could assure the people that those in charge of providing justice to them were listening.,This was one instance of a newspaper highlighting the perils that held people in a whole town and beyond hostage. There were others equally important news items in other papers that have not been mentioned here for reasons of brevity. There were so many other newspapers reporting on this and other such cases with as much strength as they could muster in a situation which didn’t quite encourage pointing out dangers and injustices to the system minders hard of hearing.,The system does not listen until sometimes one man at the top with an avowedly kind heart and lots of authority decides to take notice of a wrong somewhere on his own. If an investigation has to be undertaken to know how and why it took the law enforcers so long to get moving in Kasur, all with their fancied gadgets and tired theories and the shoves and pushes of their bosses, it must begin at the place of the crime’s occurrence. It must begin in earnest at the level of what is called the jay-i-waqooa.,This is where exists your local journalist — until one day he is discovered by his fancied big-town peers out to use his services to crack a case on great public demand. Often working without salary and every now and then called out for claiming local privilege, there is this negative profile of the local journalist that everyone is so fond of discussing. A more positive, likable and mostly apt image of his is where he is fighting it out on behalf of the underprivileged — and for justice, without any worldly gains other than recognition and fame.,He is routinely frustrated in his quest by the official machinery which is unable to — which cannot — respond to his frequent pointings-out with the same alacrity and purpose. This lack of response in turn creates room for the fake, mythological stories spun to compensate for the real ones that have not been acted upon. This is where the doctored stories come in, where the 35 punctures and the 37 bank accounts enter the collective pool. These imaginative tales only emerge after the pleas that there is prima facie a case to be urgently heard fail to move the administrators of our lives and of justice.,This is not just about a small town, not about Kasur alone. It is about our ability to move, to solve cases by accepting evidence and building on it. The myths are natural to those who show similar apathy to solving Kasur as they do to meaningfully pursuing the ‘mysterious’ murder of Benazir Bhutto, or of Liaquat Ali Khan or of those killed by this hathora group or that chaqoo group.

957,2018-02-08,No more pardons for rape,"Last week, a 17-year-old rape survivor , one of the few victims of sexual assault whose plight piqued our collective conscience. ,A hearing-impaired girl, she was sexually assaulted over two years ago by an accused who subsequently absconded. ,It was last week that the accused finally appeared in court for interim bail — only to be pardoned by the girl’s father, despite her desperate protests. ,Whilst previously claiming to have witnessed the occurrence himself, the father subsequently claimed that he filed the case by mistake.  ,The scene that played out in court was truly heart-wrenching; however, in a criminal justice system that fails to extend protective safeguards for survivors of sexual assault, it was hardly far from the norm.  ,In a country where civil society , that four women are raped everyday and conviction rates are next to zero in most districts, it is little surprise that a significant majority of rape cases are compromised before the trial is concluded.,The public outrage resulting from last week’s events have focused on the criminal justice system's treatment of crime as a private dispute between two parties and therefore reconcilable at their will. ,Whilst the ability to compromise remains a fundamental flaw in prosecution for a broad range of crimes, the same does not hold true for rape. ,Rape, as defined under Section 367 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (PPC), is a non-compoundable offence. ,This means that regardless of any agreement/settlement between the complainant and the defence, the state is under an obligation to pursue the matter until it reaches its verdict.,In 2012, the brutal gang-rape of a 13-year-old girl in Rawalpindi brought to light the rampant practice of out-of-court settlements between parties as the basis of awarding acquittals.  ,Despite confirmation of the occurrence of the offence by the medical officer, the police failed to register a First Information Report against the accused. ,It was only once the victim attempted to take her life did the Supreme Court take notice of the incident and direct the police to finally register the complaint. ,However, once the case was fixed before the trial court, the father of the victim approached the court stating that he had entered into an out-of-court settlement with the accused parties under the auspices of a , and wanted to drop the charges of gang-rape.  ,: ,Despite the non-compoundable nature of rape and gang-rape under Pakistan’s criminal laws, the trial court acquitted the accused under Section 265-K of the Code of Criminal Procedure — a provision that provides courts discretion to acquit accused parties at any stage due to a low probability of conviction.,The validity of the acquittal on the basis of compromise was assailed before the Supreme Court in a public interest petition by lawyer, Salman Akram Raja, and civil society activist, Tahira Abdullah.  ,The Supreme Court declared the acquittals of rapists on the basis of compromise by trial courts as a nullity of law. ,The Court stated that “rape was an offence against the whole society” and that even if the victim did not come forward to produce evidence due to an out-of-court settlement, it was the responsibility of the state to pursue the case to its end.,However, despite the decision of the country's top court, out-of-court settlements often remain the only means of resolution available to victims of rape. ,Out-of-court settlements are routinely brokered by police and , who pressurise the families of the victims to accept arbitrary decisions — often through intimidation and outright threats.  ,Despite a judgment of the Supreme Court in 2006 declaring decisions of , in criminal matters as unconstitutional, disputes between parties, including sexual assault, are routinely referred to these often all-male bodies for resolution. ,As the primary consideration of these bodies is to maintain order in society, the response to allegations of rape focuses on appeasing the male family members involved rather than ensuring justice for the victim. ,Under these proceedings, the victim is treated as much as an accused party, on account of bringing dishonour to her family, as the rapist. ,It is thus not uncommon to sanction rape of a woman from the family of the perpetrator by the victim’s family in order to balance the loss of honour. ,The decisions of , often enjoy the protection of police on account of their links to political leaders within the constituency.  ,In August 2017, a , ordered the rape of 16-year-old girl in Raja Ram near Multan, following allegations that her brother had raped a 12-year-old girl.  ,A law enacted in 2011, titled the ,, stipulated penalties for the use of women in dispute resolution or in customary practices. ,However, the response of police is primarily reactive and focused only on cases that are reported in the media.,: ,Notwithstanding the role played by , in resolving rape cases, victims and their families often prefer entering into out-of-court settlements rather than standing a trial.  ,The criminal justice system, like the informal ,, treats the victim as an accomplice in her own violation. A victim’s testimony is adjudicated against misogynistic stereotypes regarding her character and sexual history. ,In fact, her testimony is disregarded as false from the second she comes forward with a complaint, as a true victim of rape would never dishonour herself by drawing attention to her loss of honour.  ,During the course of the trial, the victim is subjected to scathing cross-examination by the defence, often in the presence of her rapist and in open court and is thereby forced to relive the traumatic violation. ,Witnesses and victims are provided no protection against the accused and are left at the mercy of threats and intimidation, until they are forced to abandon charges. ,: ,Despite the directives of the Supreme Court, trial courts are all too happy to accept these settlements stemming out of the desperation of those that they are tasked with protecting.,In the Supreme Court decision in 2013, wherein the unconstitutionality of out-of-court settlements was assailed, directives were issued to protect victims and their families against pressure to enter into out-of-court settlements with the accused. ,These directives included measures such as recording of victims testimony before female magistrates, in camera trial, administration and preservation of DNA tests and samples, and psychological counselling for the victim. ,However, four years on, application continues to be limited. In 2016, the National Assembly , legislation protecting the identity of rape victims and laying down procedures for medical examination and DNA testing. ,But statistics on rape continue to soar unaddressed and every day we are confronted with incidents of sexual assault more harrowing than the one reported the day before. ,Despite recent developments, conviction rates remain unchanged and most victims are forced to reconcile with the accused after having abandoned all hope for justice.,The government of Punjab, in 2017, , a pilot court named Gender-Based Violence Court in Lahore, under the directions issued by the Supreme Court in 2013. ,Tasked exclusively with handling cases of violence against women, the court is a welcome step towards introducing gender-sensitive reforms in a criminal justice system that routinely fails half of the country’s population. ,Nonetheless, the public discourse needs to focus on systematic policy and legal reforms to establish gender-responsive judicial institutions rather than operate on the basis of piece-meal legislation and impassioned responses to individual cases.

This is the second police team to come to the federal capital from Karachi to look into the case.,It is highly bizarre that in this day and age such a high-profile suspect remains on the run. ,Serious questions need to be asked about how Rao Anwar managed to slip away from the airport after he was denied boarding, and where he has been since. It is hard to fathom how the suspect can remain ‘incognito’ in the federal capital area — if that is where he remains — as this is supposed to be one of the most secure areas in the country. ,The security forces need to double their efforts to trace him; this is important in order to investigate the case and punish those involved in wrongfully killing Naqeebullah. Bringing the perpetrators to justice will also send a strong message to rogue cops involved in staged encounters. Members of the Mehsud tribal jirga reiterated their demand for the arrest of Rao Anwar in their meeting with the prime minister on Tuesday. ,The state needs to deliver on its promise of bringing Naqeebullah’s killers to justice; the first step towards this goal must be to arrest the main suspect."

They also did not ask the teenager as to who was he.,“Even the ACLC officials did not disclose to the teenager that they belong to police,” said the CTD DIG.,They demonstrated highly unprofessional behaviour while dealing with the case.

968,2018-02-09,Mashal Khan verdict,"A LYNCH mob in a university was shocking enough. ,But in the hours and days after Mashal Khan’s tragic and vile murder, the true dimensions of the horrifying crime became apparent — a young man brutally murdered in an institution of higher learning after a lie was deliberately spread that he had committed blasphemy in alleged posts on social media. ,The lie was invented by members of the university who were threatened by Mashal’s courageous activism on issues ranging from alleged corruption in the university to a hike in university fees. ,Everything the public has come to learn about Mashal since the despicable murder has shown him to be an exemplary university student and an upright, morally conscious citizen. April 13, 2017, was a dark day in the country’s history. ,So it is with some relief, though mixed with concern, that the first phase in the quest for justice for Mashal has concluded.,One death sentence, five life sentences, 25 three-year imprisonments and 26 acquittals are itself evidence of the sheer number of people involved in the crime and the difficulty of securing convictions in a case involving false but religiously motivated accusations. ,It is encouraging that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has declared its intention to file an appeal against the acquittals by the anti-terrorism court, but the retraction of statements by witnesses to Mashal’s murder will likely pose challenges. ,KP police and prosecution were surely aware that pressure would be brought to bear on witnesses to deny statements implicating the murderers and others involved in the lynching. ,Fear for personal safety and the security of family members of witnesses would have been an unfortunate reality for the witnesses in the highly charged trial. ,The KP government should have taken steps to protect key witnesses and encourage full and accurate testimonies. ,If in a case that sparked national outrage and scrutiny, the police and prosecution were unable to secure convictions of all the accused, what hope is there for cases that do not attract such intense media coverage and national interest?,Shocking though not surprising has been the response of some religious parties to the ATC verdict. The acquitted individuals have been greeted as heroes and hailed for their role in the murder of a man against whom accusations of blasphemy are demonstrably false. ,With a general election on the horizon, all political parties are likely to try and gin up support among their respective bases. ,But it is depressing that parties such as the Jamaat and JUI-F would take the violent death of an innocent young man and insist that it is those who had a part to play in his murder who have been wronged. ,The state should consider instituting a scholarship or naming a centre of education after Mashal Khan. ,There should be no ambiguity allowed on the fact that a tremendously brave young man was brutally killed by liars and bigots."

He fatally shot himself before officers stormed his hotel suite after the mass shooting.,The autopsy showed the 6-foot-1 Paddock was slightly overweight at 102 kilograms, had high blood pressure and bad teeth. But there was nothing unusual in his physical condition, even after a microscopic brain examination conducted by experts at Stanford University. His cremated remains were released to his brother in January.,The motivation for the shooting has been a mystery since Paddock opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay casino-hotel, despite intensive investigation by local police and federal authorities.,A preliminary report released last month by Las Vegas police said the high-stakes gambler had been on a losing streak, was obsessed with cleanliness, possibly bipolar and was having difficulties with his live-in girlfriend.,Investigators believe Paddock acted alone and he did not leave a suicide note or manifesto before he was found dead in the room. Police found 23 rifles and a handgun in his hotel suite and more than a dozen of the rifles were fitted with “bump stock” devices that allowed rapid-fire shooting similar to fully automatic weapons.,His live-in girlfriend, Marilou Danley, told investigators that Paddock had become “distant” in the year before the shooting and their relationship was no longer intimate, according to the preliminary report released in January.,Danley had described him as germophobic and told investigators he had reacted strongly to smells.

1001,2018-02-14,Half-justice is injustice,"			
,MOBS do many things in Pakistan: they harass women, they burn down buildings, they torch cars; they are guilty of devastating Gojra, of tearing the bodies of Muneeb and Mughees Butt to pieces, cheering the killer of a governor, mourning the death of a dictator. They are guilty also of the murder of a man named Mashal Khan. For anyone who needs to refresh their memory of the horror, in the parade of horrors that ticks by on news channels every day, he was the man killed by a mob after being dragged out of his hostel room at Abdul Wali Khan University, Mardan. ,Mashal Khan was a student of mass communications; but to his murderers he was merely a target of vengeance and hatred, all the poison of intolerance cast on a single body. Such was the level of brutality that the mob continued beating him long after he was dead. Weeks later it turned out that university officials had conspired with students who disagreed with Mashal Khan’s liberal views and orchestrated the attack. A number of them were suspended from their positions as the investigation proceeded. The student who ultimately shot Mashal Khan was also identified.,Mashal Khan was murdered last April, and last week there was the beginning of accountability for the murderers who take refuge in mobs. On Feb 7, an ATC judge announced the verdict in the Mashal Khan case at Central Jail Haripur. Per the verdict, one man was sentenced to death, five were given life sentences, and 25 other men, all accused in the case, were sentenced to three-year imprisonment. Twenty-six of the 57 men accused of the crime were acquitted. According to the judgement, there was not enough conclusive evidence that the 26 men who were set free had committed any overt act in the killing of Mashal Khan — although it appeared that they were identified in the video of the lynching. ,Mobs take refuge in the very anonymity afforded by large crowds.,The government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has said that it will appeal against the acquittals. Members of Mashal Khan’s family, still in mourning for a young man who became a victim of Pakistan’s inner brutality, did not feel that the acquittals delivered complete justice in the killing of their son.,Making sense of the verdict is vexing business. On one hand, in a country where so many killers walk with impunity, particularly when they have killed those who stand for freedom, there is a push to celebrate any punishment and any accountability as a victory. That perspective suggests that the fact that a man was sentenced to death and others to imprisonment ought to sate those who have mourned Mashal Khan.,They are wrong. The reason is simple. Punishing only half the members of a mob that was collectively responsible for the death of an innocent delivers only half the justice. Members of mobs take refuge in the very anonymity, the shadow, and the subterfuge afforded by large crowds. As experts have pointed out, mobs enable the abandonment of individual conscience. When everyone is doing it, they believe, no one is responsible for it. ,Definitions of ‘overt act’ also become superfluous in this context. What, one wonders, constitutes an overt act in the case of a rabid crowd of men intent upon and successful in beating a man to death? Is handing a cudgel to another man in the crowd an overt act? Is kicking the already dead body of a man an overt act? Does it matter if the kick or the strike or the blow struck a still living or completely dead body? Isn’t the intent of a man to watch while others kill also an act of murder by inaction? Isn’t such inaction punishable?,None of these questions have been answered. Ignoring them imposes a particular cost in Pakistan. After the verdict was given, the men who were acquitted in the case were set free. In Mardan, the city where the lynching occurred, the freed men were welcomed as heroes. A large crowd filled the Mardan motorway, blocking it completely. The crowd was addressed by impassioned clerics belonging to the JUI-F and the Jamaat-i-Islami, who vowed to push for the release of the others. According to at least one report, one of the acquitted men, who addressed the crowd from atop a vehicle, vowed to convene more mobs to kill those whom he thought were not worthy of life, lesser Muslims, lesser humans. ,It is this last fact that makes it imperative that every single person who is part of a mob be made accountable for the actions of the mob. As the ‘welcome’ gathering in Mardan (and other such gatherings in other places in the country) proves, mob murder has become a tactic for certain segments of the population. A crowd, these killers believe, can accuse, convict and kill with impunity just based on its numbers. This is not justice in any faith, in any legal system, in any age or era. Its emergence as an act that at least one half of a crowd can get away with is not something that will deter others organising killer mobs.,In the aftermath of the verdict in the Mashal Khan case, it may be time to consider legislation that makes murder by mobs a special cause of action and that clearly states that being present in crowds that kill or hurt or injure or maim anyone for any reason can be the basis of a murder charge and conviction. Otherwise, too many will participate in killer crowds, hide under the ambiguity of ‘overt act’ and continue this trend of grotesque crimes, confident in the knowledge that half of them, or more, will get away with it. ,

About half an hour later, still traumatised by what happened to our cousin, we found soldiers in the front yard of Ahed’s home where we were sitting and tried to get them to leave. For demanding they leave, my unarmed cousin is now facing charges for confronting an armed soldier.,When a video of the encounter was shown in Israel, it went viral and many Israelis demanded that we be punished. So, the following week, soldiers came to Ahed’s home in the middle of the night and she was taken away to prison. The next day, her mother Nariman was also imprisoned when she went to check on Ahed. Later that night, I was arrested as well.,I was released on bail after 16 days, but Ahed has now been languishing in prison for nearly two months, as has her mother. On Jan 31, she spent her 17th birthday in a cell. The start of her trial in a military court has been delayed several times. The latest postponement came on Tuesday, when it was rescheduled for March 11. In a blatant attempt to avoid the scrutiny of the international media, the judge also ruled that journalists will be barred from attending. The charges that Ahed faces carry a maximum sentence of 20 years. I still face charges as well.,In prison, we were treated very badly. After being arrested, Ahed was taken into a basement cell and interrogated without a parent or lawyer present. She and I were repeatedly moved from one prison to another, held with regular Israeli criminals, and subjected to sexist and degrading verbal harassment. The army knows how to place psychological pressure to break you. They deprived us of sleep and food, and I was forced to remain seated in a chair unable to move for long hours at a time.,When we were brought to military court for a hearing, it was very hard seeing our parents sitting in the back feeling worried and helpless. My uncle Bassem Tamimi, Ahed’s father, and my own father know firsthand what Israeli prison feels and smells like. Both have been imprisoned multiple times because of their non-violent resistance to Israel’s occupation. ,Bassem was named a prisoner of conscience twice by Amnesty International, which has also called for Ahed’s release. They know that we were held in a freezing-cold cell as we waited for our hearing. They know the pain of the handcuffs as they are tightened on our wrists and ankles, and how dirty the cells are, and the smell of rotten food. They understand what it feels like to be isolated in a cell — completely alone, cold and frightened, unsure of what will happen to you. Like her parents and siblings, I fear for the well-being of Ahed and the more than 300 other Palestinian children currently imprisoned by the Israeli army.,Ahed and I are the second generation of Tamimis to spend our whole lives under Israel’s oppressive 50-year military rule. We grew up under the constant watch and control of Israeli soldiers. At a young age, we had to learn resilience, determination and persistence. In order to survive, we had to be acutely aware of our surroundings at all times. Even the most basic things, such as being able to move freely or take a day trip wasn’t a possibility because of military checkpoints and other impediments. We had no room to breathe — sometimes literally, as clouds of tear gas fired by soldiers engulfed us and filled our homes.,Sadly, we are used to soldiers forcing their way into our homes, their cameras clicking as they take photos of the males in the family, documenting how many windows and doors we have, and stealing and destroying our personal belongings. There is no privacy. In addition to my father, my mother and brother have also been imprisoned. Ahed’s uncle was shot and killed by soldiers during a demonstration in 2012, while her mother was shot in the leg during another march and developed asthma because of the tear gas.,We have had our childhood stolen from us, never knowing the feeling of safety, security, and quiet. The unfortunate truth is that this isn’t only the reality of Ahed and I, or of Nabi Saleh. It is the reality of most Palestinians, especially the young ones.,Each year, Israel prosecutes between 500 and 700 Palestinian children in its military courts, which have a conviction rate of more than 99 per cent. Israel’s two-tiered legal system in the occupied West Bank has been condemned as “separate and unequal” by human rights groups. Settlers, including minors, are subject to Israeli civilian law while Palestinians of all ages are subject to martial law.,Palestinian children in Israeli military prisons endure systematic abuse — including threats and physical violence — and are pressured to sign confessions in Hebrew that they can’t read, all while being interrogated without a parent or lawyer. These abuses have been well-documented by human rights groups, and even members of the US Congress are now taking action to stop them with a bill that’s intended to make sure American aid doesn’t fund Israel’s imprisonment of Palestinian children or violations of their rights.,We cannot stand up to Israel alone. The international community and all people of conscience must also stand for justice and not tolerate Israel’s abuses of our rights, especially against children. I imagine my life without the hardships of Israel’s military rule, enjoying the simple liberty of being able to make it to class on time because there is no checkpoint closing my town. Not having to worry about me or my loved ones being killed, injured, or thrown into a military prison for standing up for our rights. Like all people want, we simply want to be able live in freedom."

They said that in the dying statement Asma had little time therefore she could only name Mujahidullah. However, both the accused had been nominated in the FIR by Asma’s brother Irfan who was an eyewitness in the case, said the sources. ,They added that both the accused had been nominated under sections 302/34. The section 34 pertains to common intention of two or more people, they said. ,The sources said that in normal cases first the blue warrants were issued by Interpol for the arrest of any person, but on the request of the interior ministry and keeping in view sensitivity of the case red warrants had been issued.

1008,2018-02-15,Bodies of 11 Pakistanis who drowned off Libya reach Islamabad,"RAWALPINDI: Tanzeel-ur-Rehman — an 18-year-old student hailing from Sambrial in Sialkot district — braved hellish circumstances and beat many odds to be on a smugglers’ boat headed for Europe, only to meet his death when the vessel capsized off Libya on the last day of last month. ,His body was brought back to the country on Wednesday, as were those of 10 other Pakistanis who died in the incident. ,Tanzeel was waiting for results of his matric exams when he left for Italy in August last year in search of a better life, said one of his cousins who had come to the Benazir Bhutto Inter­national Airport’s cargo section to collect his body. ,“When Tanzeel reached Libya via Sudan along with another cousin of his, Mohsin Ali, for onward journey to Italy they were kidnapped by a gang of human smugglers,” Usman Hussain told Dawn. ,The gang members tortured the two men and demanded a hefty ransom. They were finally released when $8,000 was paid to a person in Sudan, he said. ,Two of the men had been advised not to take undue risks to get to Europe,“When they were set free by the kidnappers they naturally thought most of their troubles were over. Little did they realise that more troubles awaited them,” said Hussain. ,When the ill-fated boat capsized, Mohsin managed to survive but Tanzeel was not so lucky. “Mohsin lost his passport in the incident; that’s why he hasn’t been able to return home yet.” ,The names of the people other than Tanzeel whose bodies have been brought back to the country are: Ikram-ul-Haq and Muhammad Qasim Baig of Mandi Bahauddin; Mirza Ghulam Fareed of Rawalpindi; Muhammad Aziz of Sargodha; and Waleed Akram, Luqman Ali, Kashif Jamil, Azmat Bibi, Mazhar Hussain and Farhan Ali of Gujrat. ,The relatives of Azmat Bibi, wife of Muhammad Ismail, were at the airport to collect her body. But they may have to visit the airport again later too, because the bodies of her two sons and husband, who were on the vessel with her, have yet to be found. ,The 19-year-old Ikram-ul-Haq’s story is no less tragic, according to his relatives. That’s because he was doing quite well in Dubai when he decided to move to Europe and lost his life in the process. ,Ikram’s elder brother, Hasnat Asghar, said he talked to his brother by telephone two days before the incident. “He told me that he would call me after reaching Italy.” ,Asghar revealed that his family had told Ikram not to board the boat simply because he had quite a good job in Dubai. ,Ghulam Rabbani, the younger brother of Ghulam Fareed, who also died in the incident, said his brother had left behind a widow, two sons and three daughters to mourn his death. ,Fareed too had been advised not to attempt to reach Europe by sea. “Before leaving for the Libyan coast to board the boat, Ghulam Fareed talked to his wife by phone, who urged him not to take too many risks,” said Rabbani."

He also claimed there was no proof or video evidence to show that Imran was present at the time of Mashal's killing.,Akhtar challenged the verdict on the grounds that as per the medico-legal report, the cause of Mashal's death was torture and beating, not gunshot wounds, which he claimed proved Imran's innocence. ,Imran had also pleaded not guilty to opening fire on Mashal during the trial, his lawyer stressed.

1018,2018-02-17,Is Kasur really the hub of child sexual abuse in Pakistan?,"			
,It hasn’t even been a fortnight since , but Kasur is back to its ways: ten rupees will buy you all kinds of child pornography in the bazaars of Kasur. The bestiality involved in Zainab’s rape and murder now seems an afterthought; there are ample consumers of child pornography still around.,The demons in Kasur have been laid bare for the past three or four years for the worst of crimes: the sexual abuse of children. In 2015, a child pornography ring was busted, where more than 200 children of the Hussain Khanwala village were being filmed. Through the mechanisms of fear and threat to life, these children and their families were pressured to keep silent. As per statistics compiled by non-governmental organization, Sahil, 285 cases of child sexual abuse were recorded in this case. ,The ring was busted and those involved were caught — young men in their 20s and 30s. The patron of this ring was alleged to an MPA from the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, Malik Saeed. He is accused of having, at the very least, protected the gang and financed their bail. Eventually the matter faded away in public imagination and the news but Kasur has been associated with child sexual abuse ever since.  ,But while the media’s glare shifted away, the number of girls having been raped and killed in Kasur piled up.,Some of it has been attributed to a serial killer and rapist, with ,. “We kept losing our children and yet the police just sat clasping their hands, waiting for the next case to appear,” says Irshad, a resident of Kasur, who had also taken part in the protest that emerged in the wake of Zainab’s murder. Much of the citizens’ anger was directed at the administration. ,However, the alleged serial killer’s involvement in the total number of children in Kasur whose rape was recorded is miniscule. According to Sahil, an NGO that works on the specific area of child sexual abuse, statistics for the first six months of 2017 reveal that in Kasur alone, a total of 129 cases of child assault were reported. Of these, 34 were abductions, 23 were rapes. In the last three years, a total of 720 incidents have been reported from Kasur. ,Clearly the issue is much larger than one case. This begs the question: is Kasur really the hub of child sexual abuse in Pakistan?,To register an instance of child sexual abuse is to acknowledge its existence — this is perhaps the reason why there is a glaring absence of statistics on child sexual abuse. ,Figures that are being quoted in the media have been collected and collated by non-governmental organizations such as Sahil who have been vested in the fight against child sexual abuse. When it comes to the government, however, no numbers are collated. In official imagination and records, no children have been raped.,			
,But an absence of statistics does not denote an absence of the crime. There is ample testimony present from children — girls and boys — to conclude that child sexual abuse is a reality in our society. It is not a phenomenon particular to a province or belief system. Nor is it a crime particular to a class — children are raped behind closed doors in both privileged and underprivileged areas. ,“The abuser is never of one type,” says Zahra Umer from the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau, Lahore. “He can be wealthy or poor, any age, belonging to any area.”,Most academic research points to the abuser being a close member of family or someone the family trusts. Being relatives gives them a layer of anonymity and deniability; many would-be rapists know that they would be the last to be suspected inside the family. Herein lies the key: the pervasiveness or possibility of child sexual abuse is so high that often it is not even considered an eventuality by parents or guardians.,“We have a culture of touching our children,” says child psychiatrist Dr Sadia. Some touches are safe, others carry evil intent. “It is so common to see someone kiss someone else’s child, or pick them up and put them on their lap, or carry them off somewhere. No one minds, and even if they do, they dare not speak out for fear of dishonouring ties with that person, especially if it’s a relative.”,This is also the reason why law enforcement and neighbours tend to stay away from cases of child sexual abuse, terming it ghar ka maamla [domestic dispute]. The reluctance of law enforcement compounds the situation, given that most victims of child abuse are already silenced by their perpetrator. ,“Most children I see say, ‘he told me if I tell anyone something will happen to my mother’, or something along those lines. Others do tell their parents but are told to keep quiet about it. It’s a terrible feeling for the child to feel unprotected by his or her own parents.” ,Sahil’s Cruel Numbers six-month report, January-June 2017, is rather illuminating. Of the 1,764 cases of child sexual abuse recorded nationwide through newspaper reportage, 752 cases pertained to abuse being carried out by an acquaintance, while 291 have been committed by an acquaintance in collusion with a stranger. Although reported cases with the police are recorded as 1,306, 23 cases were unregistered while the police refused to register another 47 cases. The Sahil report claims that cases not reported to the police have seen a rise of 109 percent as compared to the last year. In terms of geographical locations, 1,309 cases were from rural areas while 455 cases were reported in urban areas. ,Sahil’s report shows that Kasur already had nine reported cases of murder after sexual assault followed by Lahore that had six, Gujranwala and Sheikhupura both saw four cases, while Hyderabad, Sahiwal and Sargodha each recorded three cases.,Two cases were reported from Faisalabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Khairpur, Multan, Nankana, Narowal, Okara, Sialkot and Sukkur. One case was reported from Attock, DG Khan, DI Khan, Islamabad, Jamshoro, Jhang, Karachi, Muzaffarabad, Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Sanghar and Tharparkar. ,			
,Last year, on November 11, six-year-old Kainat Batool went missing in Kasur after leaving her house to buy yoghurt. After an exhaustive search, her parents reported it to the police. She was soon found alive from a rubbish heap. Doctors have recently announced that there was no evidence of physical or sexual assault on her body but the family denies this account, saying there were torture marks on her face and torso. Kainat is currently admitted in Lahore’s Children’s Hospital. Deeply traumatised, she does not remember anyone or anything. “She just screams in pain,” says an aunt. ,Soon after Kainat Batool’s recovery, on November 25, the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau was formed in Kasur. Zartab Raja who is a resident of Kasur, and who heads the Bureau, refuses to believe that Kasur is unique for sexually abusing its children irrespective of the media’s insistence that it is the hub of child sexual abuse. ,“Look at Lahore,” says Zartab. “The number of children abducted, raped and killed there is terrible. There are other cities and districts too. How can anyone blame one city for this problem?”,True enough while the media attention was on Kasur, on January 15, a ,. The corpse showed clear marks of physical violence visible. The body of 15-year-old S* — raped and murdered — was found earlier in a field on the outskirts of Sargodha. The same week, a molested body of 11-year-old Sh* was also found in Kasur, in a field. In July last year, the principal of a private school in Peshawar, Ataullah Marwat, was taken into custody after a student complained that Ataullah was committing “crimes of sexual nature” against his students. In November 2017, ten-year-old A.R* had also been sexually assaulted and murdered in a similar way in Sargodha’s district Bhalwal. A similar case took place in Pattoki.,Independent statistics show that of the 1,764 reported cases of child sexual abuse, the largest number 1,089 took place in Punjab (understandable given Punjab’s share of the population), followed by Sindh (490), KPK and Baluchistan. The numbers are also high across Punjab for not just child sexual abuse but also violence against women, and districts which top the list usually include not just Kasur, but also Gujrat, Okara and Sheikhupura. Sahil’s senior coordinating officer Mamtaz Gohar confirms that many other districts of the province are quite bad when it comes to such cases.,“In Kasur unfortunately because of the serial killer, an increase in the number of murders that have taken place after sexual assault have also increased,” says Gohar. “So in 2015 and in 2016, four children were found raped and murdered in both years, but in 2017 there were 11 such incidents [Zainab’s murder was the first case of 2018].” He also points out this does not account for several sexual abuse cases that occur and are never reported — perhaps the child never even reveals them to his parents. He adds that after Kasur, Rawalpindi was more or less in the same situation when it came to child abuse.,			
,In the recent rape and murder case in Kasur, when news broke out of common DNA samples being discovered in at least eight out of 12 of the victims’ bodies, people were more than shocked. The same man raping and killing repeatedly and everything was happening in the same two kilometre radius! ,“This man has been around since 2015, even before the porn ring was busted,” says Station House Officer (SHO) Inspector Malik Tariq Mehmood, who has been around since 2015 when the porn ring was busted, and knows of everything that has happened. “We only found this out in retrospect when we looked at all the child sexual abuse and murder cases we had.” It’s an indication of how seriously police and government officials take investigation that the DNA matching was only done after riots broke out post the Zainab case.,Till the eighth case happened, the serial killer was using under-construction or abandoned buildings to dump the bodies. Afterwards when the police locked up and sealed all empty under-construction buildings, he began using garbage dumps to dispose of the bodies. ,Zainab’s case is still fresh in the mind, but for many others, in Kasur and beyond, the wounds of rape are equally raw. ,L’s grandmother rubs her forehead as she remembers the day her granddaughter was abdu­cted in Kasur on her way to a Quran class. “She turned and waved goodbye to her mother at the end of the lane,” she says, her voice breaking. “The class was just four lanes away. She was kidnapped around this time, because her body was found just half an hour later in an abandoned building.”,The sheer force of the rape is still sinking into her. She cannot even cry. “Her arm was broken and her knee was bent when she was found. Since that day, we have never let any of our children out of sight. And we have specifically told them not to talk to strangers or accept things from them.”,“The police did absolutely nothing to help us,” says L’s uncle who has come home to drop his daughter. “Neither did the CM. But all the help we are asking for is to make our neighbourhoods safe again, and to never let this happen again.”,Even SHO Mehmood admits that it was the police’s fault, although his reasons do not lie in either inefficiency or lack of resources. “I don’t think God was with us when we were investigating,” he says. “I could swear that I wanted to solve this case, but he [the serial killer] slipped away each time.”,Objections have already been raised against the lack of time spent by the police on the crime scene investigation along with other forms of follow up investigations. Aurat Foundation’s Regional Director Mumtaz Mughal says that an inefficient police investigation causes a weak prosecution, and so does the undeserving release of sex offenders in society by the criminal justice system. In any case the conviction rates are overall very low, and offenders know it is easy to do what they want, she says. Many cases never even reach the court.,Worryingly the police have led a few encounters, two in Sargodha, one in Kasur — where they claim sex offenders have been killed. But this extrajudicial approach just brushes the issue under the carpet. It also diverts from the matter at hand: Pakistan’s children are being abused but no permanent safeguards exist to protect them. ,The best defence is of course greater education among children on what safe interactions are and where their personal boundaries are being crossed. Although these concepts are typically taught in schools at a suitable age, the term ‘sex education’ has come to assume negative connotations in Pakistan. In the renowned Lahore Grammar School, for example, many parents themselves refused to get behind the notion of providing sensitisation education to their daughters. Complaints were lodged with the provincial government too. In turn, the government too threatened to confiscate textbooks if “sex education” was to become part of the curriculum.,In a recent verdict handed down in a case against corporal punishment that was pleaded by child rights activist Miqdad Ali Naqvi, the Punjab government was ordered to form a child rights commission. This was on December 22, 2017.,“The LHC judge noticed that the UN Conventions of the Rights of the Child 1989 were not being met,” says Naqvi. “We are still awaiting the formation of the Commission.”,Child rights’ activist Iftikhar Mubarik has spent the last few years pushing the government for the same reason but in vain. “After the 18th amendment we needed a provincial level commission that would take care of every right of the child including any violence or abuse they face,” he says. “The purpose is to have inter-departmental collaboration, so no overlapping or problems would occur. Right now we have laws enacted that are contradictory to each other so we need one department looking after children’s matters.”,So, for example, if the Right to Education law says that education is compulsory for children aged five to 16 years, a law banning children from working brick kilns shows age 14 as the age limit. ,“At the governmental level there are verbal or on paper policies, but the lack of a child rights commission proves that the government is non-serious,” he says. Meanwhile, Kainat’s neighbours, who are also her relatives say that none of the children are now allowed to come and go as they please. “We pick and drop them, no matter what,” says one elder. ,But all this is easier said than done. L’s grandmother caresses her picture on a poster which the family carried during a protest in June last year. And says a silent prayer: may no daughter of ours face such a fate ever again.,

There were 54 SHOs who were [involved] in the operations [carried out under the supervision] of Gen Babar [the then interior minister]. Fifty-three of them were killed and this is the boy who survived.” ,When the MQM returned to power Rao Anwar went underground, the PPP co-chairman said. ,He interrupted the anchor when she said the officer was involved in 444 extrajudicial killings in ‘encounters’.  “This is merely talk... Why 440 petitions [against him] are in courts,” he asked. ,He said the Sindh government had not submitted the report to the Supreme Court that said Rao Anwar was involved in 444 extrajudicial killings. He said the Sindh police had filed the report and the inspector general of police was appointed by the apex court and not the chief minister. ,The former president maintained that the report against Rao Anwar was a result of grouping within the police. ,Without mentioning the Naqeebullah Mehsud killing case, he said the issue had been sensationalised by media, “Twitter and other social media brigade” and “that doesn’t necessarily mean that it is a fact”. ,When the anchor pointed out that it was a joke that an absconding police officer was freely contacting people on WhatsApp, he said the officer did not call him on WhatsApp. ,“Not you... he called Sindh IG,” the anchor said.,Mr Zardari said the IGP should have asked intelligence agencies to trace that call. ,When asked if the apex court did the right thing by keeping A.D. Khowaja as Sindh IG, the former president said: “That’s controversial. Sup­reme Court is already very controversial... I don’t want to go there.”"
1020,2018-02-17,SC regrets extending ‘fair chance’ to fugitive Rao Anwar,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Friday regretted extending a fair chance to fugitive Rao Anwar — a senior Karachi police officer — and issued a show-cause notice to him for committing contempt of court by not surrendering himself before the court and ordered law enforcement agencies to locate his whereabouts and arrest him. ,“The officer has lost a great opportunity by not appearing in court today,” observed Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, adding that the officer should have taken the chance. “The sympathy now for him has ended,” regretted the chief justice while heading a two-judge SC bench. ,The Supreme Court had taken notice of the tragic murder of 27-year-old Naqeebullah Mehsud from South Waziristan who was killed in an encounter by a police team allegedly led by Senior Superintendent of Police Rao Anwar in Karachi on Jan 13. ,The murder sparked outrage on social media when his family rejected claims that Mehsud was a member of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. The deceased was aspiring to become a model and the social media contains several of his pictures that appear to have been taken for a modelling photo shoot. ,Issues show-cause notice to police officer for contempt of court, orders his arrest ,At the last hearing on Feb 13, the court had asked Rao Anwar to surrender himself before the court by Friday and directed Sindh and Islamabad police to extend security and facilitate his appearance before the court. ,On Friday, the court commenced the hearing in the morning and then waited for over 50 minutes in the hope that he will come, but in vain. ,Sindh Inspector General Allah Dino Khowaja informed the court that Rao Anwar had made a WhatsApp call when the court had asked him to come and informed him that he would appear in the court on Friday. The IG said he had also given assurances to the officer to facilitate him in this regard. ,The chief justice ordered freezing all bank accounts of Rao Anwar and providing security to the witnesses in the case. He observed that the court had responded in a positive manner to the letter the fugitive officer sent to it by assuring him of providing security and appointing a new joint investigation team (JIT) to probe afresh allegations of extrajudicial killings. ,The apex court also withdrew its previous order of providing security to Rao Anwar and maintained its earlier directive for the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Military Intelligence (MI) and Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to extend all possible assistance to the police in arresting the absconding officer. ,The court directed the police to update it about the progress, but at the same time regretted that it was a responsibility of the police to arrest Rao Anwar. ,The chief justice also recalled that the Punjab police had been given three days to arrest the suspect involved in raping and killing minor girl Zainab and they managed to do it. ,“Though we recognise the Sindh police efforts, no results are forthcoming,” the chief justice said while pointing towards IG Khowaja. ,Senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi, appearing on behalf of the father of Naqeebullah Mehsud, informed the court that apart from Rao Anwar, 15 police officers, including ASIs and head constables, were absconding, adding that Rao Anwar had gone to Dubai 74 times. He requested the court to issue a contempt of court notice against Rao Anwar. ,The court initiated contempt charges against the police officer under the Contempt of the Court Ordinance 2003 and Article 204 of the Constitution."

Two death sentences, accompanied by Rs1 million fine each, were imposed on him under ATA and Pakistan Penal Code. A 7-year jail sentence and Rs100,000 fine was further awarded for concealing the body in a trash heap.,Additionally, Rs1 million from the penalties imposed will be paid to the victim's heirs, the judge ruled. ,Zainab's mother, Nusrat Bibi, demanded that the execution of the death penalties be carried out in public. ,“I want him to be hanged publicly at the place where he took Zainab,” she told reporters after the verdict. ,Ali faces further charges in the cases of at least seven other children he attacked — five of whom were murdered — in a spate of assaults that had stoked fears a serial child killer was on the loose. ,He has confessed to all eight attacks, including the death of Zainab, , reported. ,Prosecutor General Ehtesham Qadir, who spoke to media after the sentencing, said the accused had been given ample chance to defend himself, but he chose to confess his crimes despite being told clearly that any information he divulged would be used against him. ,""When he was read the charges, we asked the court to let Imran Ali deliberate the matter for 40 minutes,"" the prosecutor said.

Khowaja on Saturday said that police 'encounters' indicate a failure of the criminal justice system as a whole and not of police.,Speaking at a seminar organised by the Citizens Police Liaison Committee (CPLC) titled Effective and Accountable Policing, the IG opined that it was ‘extremely difficult’ to strike a balance between effective policing, due process and people’s expectations.,Citing three recent high-profile cases namely Naqeebullah Mehsud, Intizar Ahmed and Maqsood — all of whom were killed in police shootouts — the IG admitted shortcomings on the part of police but also emphasised that this was perhaps the first time that police has offered itself for accountability before the judiciary and society.,Referring to civil society’s petitions through which he was granted ‘administrative autonomy’ over provincial police by the Supreme Court, Khowaja explained that transfers and postings were not the only jobs of the IG office and that his role also demands strategic planning. ,He also complained about a lack of financial autonomy and wondered how the police could operate when its proposals for financing are declined. ,The IG pointed out that six months ago, Rs10 million in compensation was announced for each martyred policeman but the Sindh home department has yet to honour that promise.,“We have serious problems but we have to improve efficiency and everybody has to play their role,” the IG said.,He remarked that policing was the responsibility of the entire community. Citing the Police Rules 1934, he said police's job is to assist the community in prevention and detection of crimes. If certain officers create problems, then ""we have to work together to get rid of them"".,“Together we have to stand for the rule of law,” he added.,Khowaja said policing was not an easy task and reminded his audience that 1,183 policemen have been killed in Sindh since 2007, with a bulk of the deaths taking place in Karachi.,Meanwhile, DIG South Azad Khan while giving a presentation about Naqeebullah Mehsud, Intizar and Maqsood murder cases said that the police officials involved in the incidents have been proceeded against under criminal charges and departmental proceedings.,“Positive criticism is always welcome, however, undue criticism lowers the morale of police and has a negative bearing on police performance and law and order,” he said.,Sindh police are currently in a transition from regime policing to ""democratic policing"" and need strong public support in this regard, he said.,DIG Khan regretted that police are still being governed by the Police Act of 1861, which was not consistent with principles of democratic policing and suggested promulgation of a ‘modern’ law that made police truly accountable before the law and public."

Some of them claim videos are uploaded on the dark web from Pakistan. We need to look into this and find out who is behind this. I have even gotten to know that children are kidnapped, raped and killed according to the desires of users of the dark web and the videos of these are then uploaded,” he said.,Mr Khan suggested the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and its Cyber Crime Wing should be directed to look into it and that the culprits be hanged in public.,NA body discusses making child sexual abuse non-cognisable offence, hanging offenders in public,“We might face pressure from the UN and human rights organisations but we have to do this to save our children. Iran and Saudi Arabia are already doing this,” he said.,He added that PTI Chairman Imran Khan and the Punjab chief minister have also demanded that those responsible for child sexual abuse should be hanged in public and that the government should therefore not succumb to international pressure.,The debate regarding the punishment for child sexual abuse started after the case of seven-year-old Zainab who was kidnapped on Jan 4 in Kasur and was killed after being sexually abused. ,A few days later, four-year-old Asma was killed in Gujjar Garhi in Mardan. After these two cases, the public has been demanding legislation regarding the appropriate punishment for child sexual abuse.

1070,2018-02-27,Defenceless minorities,"RELIGIOUS minorities in this country often find themselves marginalised and persecuted by both state and society. ,This was evident recently in the horrific case of a Christian man who was compelled to jump from the fourth floor of the FIA office in Lahore after reportedly refusing to sexually assault his cousin — an accused in a blasphemy case who is charged with posting objectionable material on Facebook. ,Miraculously, Sajid Masih survived with fractured legs and a broken jaw to tell his bone-chilling story. ,While interrogating Sajid, an FIA cybercrime team allegedly tortured him, confiscated his mobile phone and tried to force him to assault his cousin. The thought itself is utterly contemptible: how can elements of the state misuse their authority to denigrate people, defenceless minorities among them, in such a manner? How can they push them towards the abyss? ,Sinking to this new low of abhorrence for religious minorities is not surprising when the tyranny of an intolerant majority is visibly encouraged by certain politicians, even lawmakers. ,Further, the complainants in this case, the religious outfit TLYRA, recorded their statements at the same time the accused and his family were at the FIA office which is right before Sajid jumped from the fourth floor. ,Therefore, the urgency for a thorough investigation to ascertain the truth behind this sordid episode and identify the culprits and instigators cannot be stressed enough. It is only when the guilty in this case, and in many other instances where injustice in the name of religious intolerance is deemed kosher, are brought to task that religious minorities in this country can heave a sigh of relief.,When the blasphemy law is misused to persecute minorities for their faith or to settle personal scores — as evidence overwhelmingly indicates — state oversight must ensure severe punishment for the culprits. ,Then, over the weekend as Rome’s ancient Coliseum was lit up in blood red in solidarity with persecuted Christians globally, we were reminded by the family of Aasia Bibi — condemned to death in 2010 under the blasphemy laws — that the fate of Pakistan’s minorities is often one of heartbreak. ,If our state seriously wishes to improve its human rights credentials — if just to retain its association with international organisations that insist on better treatment of the country’s minorities — it must ensure security to vulnerable Christians and those of other faiths, and stop ceding space to violent ideologues."

They have asked for the constitution of an independent committee of medical experts to oversee Sajid’s treatment.,Several lawyers present at the protest raised the issue of police torture of suspects, especially those belonging to religious minorities. ,The statement undersigned by civil society activists says: “It has come to light that Sajid and Patras were tortured by officers of the cyber crime wing and were coerced into sexually assaulting one another. Sajid, pleaded with them to stop.

1090,2018-03-02,Pakistanis at Gitmo,"ALTHOUGH reduced to a few dozen prisoners — six of them Pakistani nationals — Guantanamo Bay has held terror suspects indefinitely, for the most part without fair trials. ,Years of arbitrary detention and the use of sustained abuse and excessive interrogation techniques, that reportedly have not stopped, makes the case for the prison’s closure even more compelling. ,This week a group of independent experts reporting to the UN Human Rights Council have asked for the release of Pakistani national Ammar al-Baluchi while condemning both detainee conditions and the use of degrading interrogation techniques. ,Held at Guantanamo since 2006, his imprisonment breaches at least 13 international human rights covenants, they said. ,Denied due process and a fair trial under the US judicial system, even the UN special rapporteur on torture found the prisoner was still being tortured. ,If there are reasons to suspect Ammar al-Baluchi for acts of terrorism (he was briefly married to Aafia Siddiqui, and is a nephew of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed), there must be a fair investigation and trial. ,It must be noted that the UN has pointed to his detention as “an act of discrimination based on his status as a foreign national and his religion”. ,Moreover, the Pakistani government should push for fair trials for other detained citizens — including Ahmed Rabbani, a taxi driver rendered in 2002. ,The failure of the Foreign Office to pursue cases of detained citizens cleared for legal release from Guantanamo but still languishing incommunicado is reprehensible. ,It is hard to recall when our government has registered its protest over the torture of detainees in such jails. ,Justice Project Pakistan, for instance, had alerted the Lahore High Court to the inhumane treatment of Pakistani prisoners at Bagram in Afghanistan — until then, the government had been apparently clueless about the fate of many men rendered to the Americans by the Musharraf regime. ,Indefinite detention without charge is intolerable. ,The US must recognise civilian courts have brought more terrorist suspects to trial than military tribunals in Guantanamo. ,For this, Congress must release funds to try alleged terrorists on US soil. ,Torture must not continue on any American president’s watch. ,A Pakistani detainee on hunger strike encapsulates this fight against injustice: “I don’t want to die, but after four years of peaceful protest I am hardly going to stop ... I will definitely stop when President Trump frees the prisoners who have been cleared, and allows everyone else a fair trial.” "

1093,2018-03-03,Quite a happy Holi,"			
,THIS year’s Holi has brought various bits of good news to the country’s Hindu community, leaving one wishing that the festival marks a turnaround in Pakistan’s treatment of its minorities rather than just a series of one-off happy events.,First, Veerji Kolhi, the tireless campaigner for the rights of the Tharis, who was convicted by a lower court on trumped-up murder charges, was freed by the Sindh High Court after remaining behind bars for nearly a year.,Whether it is bonded labour or forced conversion or rape and murder, Veerji Kolhi has a sparkling track record of standing by the oppressed and the wronged, perhaps because he is not found wanting in empathy, having been a part of a bonded labour family as a child.,How long will this feel-good factor continue is anybody’s guess given that forced conversions have not been halted.,It is to the credit of young campaigner Meena Gabeena, who knew Kolhi personally due to her relief work in Tharparkar over the years and believed in his innocence, that she knocked on all doors possible to see the wrongfully jailed lawyer-activist finally step out of prison.,The Kolhi family were in the bondage of a local landlord who demanded a sum of Rs65, 000 for their release, an amount beyond their means then, Meena wrote in her blog last year. They slaved for four years before the notable Shakeel Pathan, the late anti-bonded labour activist, enabled their release.,Today, Veerji Kolhi is himself a seasoned campaigner and his release will bring hope to multitudes of the voiceless oppressed as will the election of his sister Krishna to the upper house of parliament on a PPP ticket. What a remarkable journey and story of determination and courage.,Veerji Kolhi’s release came towards the end of the week, and a day earlier, to the relief of the Hindu community in Mithi, the Sindh home minister and the IGP announced at a joint news conference the arrest of the killers (and abettors) of the two Hindu traders who had been shot dead recently.,The murder of Dilip Kumar and Chanda Kumar ostensibly during a robbery, had sent shockwaves in the community and many in Mithi seemed pessimistic the crime would ever be solved and the perpetrators arrested.,It was, therefore, a positive development that the community was informed that all those involved in the crime are behind bars, the murder weapon has been recovered and the money-stuffed wallet of one of the victims has also been found.,This news was even more welcome after initial rumours that the murderers would not be arrested as they had some influential political backers. However, one troubling loose end remained. The only eyewitness of the crime, himself a Hindu, is said to have committed suicide.,Nagzi Meghwar’s body was found floating in a water tank in his house in Mithi. One hopes that the investigators find nothing sinister in the eyewitness’s death and that there is sufficient evidence to convict those arrested without the testimony of the only eyewitness.,Nonetheless, more good news continued to come in as an army officer tweeted a letter signed by the administrator of DHA, Karachi, that the “competent authority” had approved allotment of land to build a temple at the request of representatives of the Hindu community.,If these were events were positive, the continued embrace of the Hindu community by top national leaders must have lifted their morale and spirits even as these gestures may not have been more than merely symbolic.,Where PTI leader Imran Khan tweet-greeted the Hindus on Holi, the PPP’s Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari invited many members of the community to Bilawal House and offered felicitations personally. I am sure there were other politicians who did the same and I apologise if I missed their messages.,How long will this feel-good factor continue is anybody’s guess given that forced conversions have not been halted and the community in Tharparkar in particular is often targeted with kidnapping, followed by conversion. This causes them great anxiety.,While this Holi indeed appeared happy for the Hindus, other minorities continued to feel the heat with Christians and Ahmadis both at the receiving end of unwelcome attention. And what Patras Masih and his cousin Sajid Masih received in Lahore was much worse and graver than mere unwelcome attention.,Given that the two young men come from the most dispossessed of the dispossessed in society also means that they are unlikely to get justice. If the attitude of the Punjab deputy speaker in the house was any indication the matter is a non-issue.,The gentleman in question dismissed rather contemptuously Shanila Ruth, a woman member belonging to the PTI, who wanted to raise the ordeal of the Sajid Masih who jumped to escape horrendous torture (or was just pushed out of the window) for refusing, according to him, to sexually assault his young cousin in custody for alleged blasphemy.,Sajid Masih is currently in hospital with multiple fractures and it is a miracle he survived that fall from a fourth floor window of an FIA interrogation room. His statement about what happened there from his hospital bed would drive a dagger through any heart.,The predominantly Christian neighbourhood where the two cousins lived was gripped by fear which spread like wildfire after Patras Masih was alleged to have committed blasphemy and was picked up by police before being handed over to FIA as a smartphone was supposed to have been used for the purpose.,While this episode again underlined the vulnerability of the poor Christians in the country, the lives of the financially and socially far more stable Ahmadis continue to be marred by persecution. Now, lists of Ahmadi government servants are reportedly being prepared on court orders.,One can only hope and pray that these lists will remain confidential and not be used by the state to discriminate against and persecute a set of loyal citizens solely on the basis of their faith.,

,LAHORE: A number of rights activists and members of civil society on Saturday staged a demonstration in front of the Lahore Press Club to press for the recovery of Raza Khan, a peace educationist who went missing in the city on Dec 2, last year. ,They included the father of Mr Khan who pleaded the authorities concerned to have his son located at the earliest. ,The activists carried placards demanding the recovery of Mr Khan. Prominent among them were Diep Saeeda of the Institute of Peace and Secular Studies, and Mr Raheemul Haque. ,Raza Khan belonged to the Aaghaz-i-Dosti initiative and used to work for peacebuilding between Pakistani and Indian schoolchildren. He also used to annually publish a calendar containing art pieces by six each Indian and Pakistani schoolchildren, and messages by elders. ,He went missing on Dec 2 after attending a discussion on Faizabad sit-in at Lowkey Lokai, an office near Garden Town. ,The demonstrators said it had been three months since the disappearance of Raza Khan. His family and friends had tried all avenues, including the government, Lahore High Court and Commission of Inquiry of Enforced Disappearances, to bring him back but had thus far been disappointed. There had already been eight hearings of the high court, and one hearing of the commission without any information of his whereabouts, health, why and by whom he was picked up. ,They said they see families of the disappeared and civil society protesting in all parts of the country and not a single week goes by without a protest. But the state seems to be unaccountable and above its own law, which will only lead to further insecurity, and restriction of citizen rights of expression and association. ,Meanwhile, the Christian community also protested outside the press club calling for a full investigation into the alleged attacks on cousins Sajid and Patras Masih. They stated that even if the suspect was found guilty no person should be treated in this brutal manner. ,Under the banner of British Pakistani Christians Association, the protesters called for the “trumped up” charges to be dropped by the judiciary and the Federal Investigation Agency officers involved in violence against the suspects to be sacked and tried. ,The protesters were holding placards and shouted slogans against police highhandedness, demanding justice for Sajid Masih. Speakers appealed to the chief justice of Pakistan, army chief and political leadership to consider Christians as Pakistanis and treat them with equal respect as everyone else was. They said due process of law should be followed when someone is alleged to have committed a crime and not slapped with Section 295-C straightaway."

1104,2018-03-06,Families of the ‘disappeared’ hear nothing but silence from officialdom,"			
,KARACHI: On a sunny weekend afternoon, the road leading to New Rizvia Society in Karachi’s Safoora Goth area has very thin traffic. A huge billboard overlooking the visitors at the society’s main gate demands the recovery of Engineer Syed Mumtaz Hussain Rizvi. Rizvi’s wife and nephew talk and share the details of his disappearance in the living room, decorated with religious inscriptions and photos. ,Rizvi ran a business of computer hardware and was on a “business trip” to Quetta in January, when he lost contact with his family on the 23rd of that month. His wife, Zehra, recalls the day when she last talked to her husband. ,“He had said that he was going to be in Karachi by 9pm. We waited for him throughout the night, and when he didn’t show up, we inquired his friends, partners, and other acquaintances, but he was nowhere to be found,” she says. “I last talked to him at 5.30pm that day, and his mobile phone went off shortly afterwards. We are not in contact with him since then.” ,The family then approached the Sachal police station, which registered a complaint — not an FIR. “We have also filed a petition in the Sindh High Court where our case has been heard once, and the next hearing is on March 8.” The complaint filed says that he had “left home for work on Jan 23, but didn’t return”, which is different from the narrated story according to which he was returning from Quetta. She attributes the discrepancy to the fact that the family at that time “didn’t know where he went missing from. We don’t know his last whereabouts to this day”, says his wife.,‘Holding someone in illegal confinement is a violation of human rights’,A doctoral student at a private university in Karachi, Rizvi also served in the editorial board of a monthly Urdu magazine which carried scientific and educational articles. The disappearance of the father of five — four daughters and a son — has traumatised the family. “Education of my children is suffering and so is our daily routine; our lives have been completely altered after this incident,” says Zehra. “To this day, we have received no phone call or any piece of information from any person, group or law enforcement agency which would inform us about him.”,The family stresses that he was not part of any religious or political party, concerned with only “welfare work”. ,			
,“He used to help people in need and kept others before himself. How could a man with such a busy schedule be involved in any [subversive] activity?”, she questions, demanding that he be produced in court with all available evidence if he was wanted by the state.,Boys are winding up their game of cricket in a street in Abbas Town, a Shia neighbourhood in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal area. The home of Syed Samar Abbas is not difficult to locate as it is fairly close to a community clinic-cum-mosque. Some children of the family are studying in a courtyard as Abbas’s brother, Ghazanfer, talks to this writer. Abbas, he says, was on a routine trip to Islamabad for his “business-related” work in January 2017’s first week. Jan 7 was the day when the family last heard from Abbas, who has been missing since. ,Father of three, Abbas had previously worked as an IT professional in Saudi Arabia, and had returned to Pakistan a few years ago, after which he had set up his own software development business. It was in this connection that he had been to Islamabad from where he never returned. The FIR registered at Ramna police station of the federal capital quotes his family that he was last known to be in Sector G-11. ,His disappearance coincided with the disappearance of online activists in early 2017, most of whom made it back to their homes shortly afterwards, but Abbas’s trail has only grown colder over time. The family insists that Abbas’s case was not in any way connected with that of the online activists. ,“Abbas was a field activist who used to work for community welfare, and had good coordination with the law enforcement agencies”, says Ghazanfer. His father, an income-tax adviser at the Lahore High Court, has been ailing and so is his mother; his parents demand the recovery of their son. ,“Sindh Home Minister Sohail Anwar Siyal had assured us that he will be recovered when we marched for his recovery back in October 2017”, says his mother, adding that they had contacted the National Commission for Human Rights, and Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearance — informally known as the Justice Javed Iqbal Commission — but they had received no positive news yet. ,The family of the 40-year-old has also filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court for his recovery, but no headway has been made. Like Rizvi’s family, Abbas’s family also said that they wanted to see him tried in court if he was involved in any act of sabotage. “He was a loving father, a caregiver to his ailing parents, and a patriotic citizen, his disappearance has pushed his children and us in a perpetual state of trauma.” ,Senior official of Sindh Police’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) Raja Umar Khattab says that the two missing persons were not in the custody of the CTD. “We have a system in place, through which we legally arrest the suspects, and produce them in court,” he says, adding that he had no knowledge of the whereabouts of the mentioned persons as his unit was not dealing with the matter. “Abbas had helped law enforcement in producing witnesses in some cases a while back, however, the CTD doesn’t have any intelligence on his disappearance.”,On the other hand, vice chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) Sindh chapter, Asad Iqbal Butt believes that the so-called ‘missing persons’ were in custody of law enforcement agencies. He estimates that about 150 people were missing from Sindh of which about 60 hailed from Karachi. He said that a fair trial was the basic right of all the citizens, and holding someone in illegal confinement was a violation of human rights. “Activities like these bring bad name to otherwise respectable institutions, therefore if [the persons] have done anything wrong, let the courts decide the matter,” Butt says.

Appearance of a convict before courts is not necessary in appeal proceedings. ,The bench adjourned hearing till March 12, directing the jail superintendent to present the record of the case. ,In his jail-appeal, Imran Ali pleaded that he had confessed to his crime and saved the precious time of the trial court. He said in developed countries the courts treated criminals with leniency if they made a confession but the trial court did not show leniency in his case despite the confession. The condemned prisoner urged the court to set aside his death penalty and also commute other sentences. ,Talking to the media, Mr Ansari expressed dissatisfaction with police investigation and complained that justice had not been done in the case. He said he had made two telephone calls to Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar but his staff did not get him through to the CJ. ,The chief justice, during the final hearing of suo motu case of Zainab’s murder, had asked Mr Ansari to feel free to call him in case of any complaint. ,On Feb 17, an anti-terrorism court had awarded death sentence on four counts to Ali following a four-day trial conducted in the central jail. The convict was also separately given life imprisonment and a seven-year jail term in addition to the death penalty. ,The trial court had handed down the punishment on the basis of forensic, material and circumstantial evidences presented by the prosecution in addition to the confession made by Imran. ,The convict had initially denied the charges against him and opted to contest the trial, however, he pleaded guilty the next day.

His murder sparked an outcry in the social media when his family members rejected claims that Mehsud was a member of the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. ,At the last hearing on Feb 16, the SC had issued a show-cause notice to SSP Malir Rao Anwar for committing contempt of court by not surrendering before it despite extending a fair chance. The law enforcement agencies were also ordered by the court to locate his whereabouts and arrest him.,On Monday Inspector General Sindh Allah Dino Khowaja in a report had conceded before the court that the investigation team had made sincere efforts to locate and arrest the nominated accused Anwar Ahmed and even had requested ISI, MI and the Intelligence Bureau to extend cooperation in tracing out the location of Rao Anwar and other accomplices through their available mobile phone numbers and WhatsApp activity. ,Moreover request was also moved to DG FIA to locate and search for the absconding accused and issuance of Interpol warrants in response of which Blue Notices have also been issued by Secretariat General ICPO Interpol, Lyon, France against Rao Anwar. ,The report also admitted that FIR has been registered against 24 police officers but only 10 nominated accused have been arrested from DSP Qamar Ahmed Sheikh to sub-inspectors, assistant sub-Inspectors, head constables, police constables etc.,The investigation officer of the case has submitted an interim charge sheet before the administrative judge antiterrorism courts, Sindh High Court, on March 1, which has been referred to ATC-II Karachi for trial. ,“Apart from Rao Anwar, there are 13 other police officers absconding from the rank of PC, HC, ASI, SI. It is unbelievable that the entire police force and intelligence network of Pakistan cannot locate them,” wondered senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi while talking to Dawn. ,The counsel who appeared on behalf of the father of Naqeebullah pleaded before the court to order for the CCTV footage, also expressing reservations that Rao Anwar was getting facilitation by certain quarters. ,But the chief justice observed that the court does not wish to take charge of the efforts to locate Rao Anwar. ,In his report IG Sindh had also mentioned about his letter to the Airport Security Force requesting for the provision of CCTV footage of cameras installed at the Jinnah International Airport Karachi and Benazir Bhutto International Airport Islamabad covering the movement of passengers right from the entrance to the airport till departure by the aircraft including for Jan 20, 2018. ,The court also deplored that it allowed Sindh police to seek assistance from law enforcement agencies and yet the suspect has not been arrested.

1107,2018-03-06,Footprints: Fighting for a life lived in fear,"			
,ABID Masih sits on a stone bench outside the emergency ward at Lahore’s Mayo hospital, nervously scratching his salt-and-pepper beard. ,Inside, his son Sajid is fighting for his life. Lying in the intensive care unit, the 24-year-old’s face is swollen, his legs wrapped in casts, and his body covered in bruises. Blood drips into a small bottle hanging by his left leg.,“The days are starting to meld together,” says Abid Masih, when I ask him how long he has been here.,On Feb 23, Sajid Masih threw himself from a fourth-floor window at the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Lahore headquarters during an interrogation into blasphemy charges. His cousin, Patras, 21, stands accused of having shared an allegedly blasphemous image to a Facebook messenger group. Sajid was called in for a digital forensic examination of his phone, to ascertain whether the image had been sent to him. During the examination, Sajid struggled with investigators, made a dash for the window, paused for a moment, and then jumped.,That Sajid jumped, and did not intend to survive the fall is a fact. Why he did so, however, remains open to a great deal of dispute.,Investigators say they were about to begin the examination of Sajid’s phone when he panicked and threw himself out of the window. Sajid tells a markedly different story. His lawyer quotes the young man as saying that he was repeatedly beaten and accused of having committed blasphemy. ,“They beat him with computer wires and slapped and punched him,” says Aneeqa Maria, the lawyer. Four FIA officials then attempted to force Sajid to perform oral sex on Patras, Maria says. “They forced him, and then he said no, and he begged for forgiveness.”,His father completes the story: “Sajid said that he would rather die than do this. That is why he jumped.”,Back at the family’s home in the Baba Bandook Saeein neighbourhood of the village of Dhair, about 20km from the centre of Lahore, the streets are quiet. The narrow concrete lanes, many of them broken from wear, form a tight grid, with dozens of brick houses crowded together. There is sewage in many of the streets, and the smell of faeces is overpowering, as those left in the neighbourhood gather to recall what happened on the afternoon of Feb 19.,“We fled in fear,” says Parveen Bibi, 70, who has lived here for decades. “We were afraid we would have been beaten, or that they would have broken into our homes.”,That day, scores of angry protesters stormed the neighbourhood, demanding that Patras Masih be produced. When it became clear that Patras had already fled the neighbourhood, they brought cans of petrol to burn it down.,“When I came home from work, I saw a lot of people gathered, raising slogans. They were shouting that a blasphemer can never be forgiven,” says Waris Masih, 54, a labourer.,Most of the neighbourhood’s roughly 800 Christians hurriedly left the area. Later that night, Patras surrendered himself to the police.,Blasphemy allegations are often linked to existing disputes, either between individuals or communities. In this case, however, it is unclear whether such a dispute existed. ,“Relations with the Muslims have always been good here, in the past,” said Inderias Masih, Patras’ father. The only such dispute he could think of was a fight between Muslim and Christian youths over playing space at a nearby cricket field, three months ago.,Most residents of Baba Bandook Saeein lack property deeds or any formal paperwork linked to their homes, Maria, the lawyer, says, suggesting a land grab may have been the motive.,There is, however, another possibility.,The Tehreek Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah (TLYRA), a religious group led by firebrand cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi, has championed the accuser’s case, stepping in to lodge the FIR in the name of local office holder Muhammad Owais. TLYRA posters are visible all over the Muslim parts of Baba Bandook Saeein, advertising a local event where Rizvi was due to speak. Owais’ name is prominent on the poster.,The TLYRA has been emboldened since it blocked a major highway into Islamabad for three weeks in November. Having emerged from that confrontation with all of its demands met, the organisation has been holding political rallies, fighting by-elections and making known its intention to fight in the 2018 general elections.,“We have always been very clear about our position on blasphemy,” says Ejaz Ashrafi, the group’s information secretary. “After the Faizabad sit-in, people have now heard about us a lot more. Our position is the same, but now people are much more drawn to us.”,However, moments after denying that the TLYRA was involved in the mob attack on the village, Ashrafi also threatens that anyone who, in their view, commits blasphemy should not consider themselves safe. ,Back at the FIA headquarters, their understanding of the motive behind the case is somewhat different.,“[Patras] has given a sacrifice, so that the rest of his family can now be relocated and seek asylum in any other country,” says Khwaja Hammad, an FIA deputy director. “But not Patras. We won’t let him off the hook.”, "
1108,2018-03-06,Senate committee recommends punishment for false accusations of blasphemy,"A Senate Special Committee on Human Rights on Tuesday recommended that perpetrators of false accusations of blasphemy be given the same punishment as set for those convicted for blasphemy.,""Anyone falsely accusing someone of blasphemy should be subjected to the same punishment as a person convicted of blasphemy,"" the recommendation stated.,The punishment for blasphemy in Pakistan ranges from several years in prison to a death sentence. Under existing laws, a person making a false accusation can only face proceedings under Section 182 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which entails a maximum punishment of six months, or a mere Rs1,000 fine.,The recommendation also stated that anyone looking to register a blasphemy case at a police station should have to bring two witnesses to support their accusation.,However, committee member Senator Mufti Abdul Sattar, who belongs to the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl, opposed the recommendations, terming them ""an attempt to sabotage the blasphemy law."" ,""Are there no other laws in the country that are being misused?"" the legislator complained.,""We are not trying to make any changes to the blasphemy law, we are trying to keep people from misusing it,"" Senator Farhatullah Babar clarified.,The committee has decided to forward its recommendations to the Council of Islamic Ideology.,Last year, in October, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had suggested that parliament make the blasphemy law tougher by fixing the same punishment for any person misusing it or falsely accusing someone of blasphemy.,The recommendation was made in a long order addressing a a petition seeking the elimination of blasphemous content from social media.,IHC Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui had said in his order that due to the misuse of the law, critics even demanded abolishing it, adding it was better to stop exploitation of the law rather than abolishing it.,At the time, the judge had referred the matter to the legislature.,The Interior Ministry had on February 16 submitted to Justice Siddiqui a draft of proposed amendments to the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016. The amendments had sought to equate punishments for a false accusation of blasphemy to the punishment for actually committing blasphemy.,The matter had first been brought before the IHC by the Lal Masjid-led Shuhada (Martyr's) Foundation, which had initially accused five bloggers of uploading blasphemous content on social media last year.,However, the Federal Investigation Agency had later informed the IHC that the bloggers, who had been forcefully disappeared early last year, were not involved in blasphemy and the investigation agency had not found any tangible evidence against them.,Justice Siddiqui had subsequently proposed invoking the blasphemy-related Section 295 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which deals with those who falsely accuse another of blasphemy.,In his116-page verdict, Justice Siddiqui had discussed in detail the common criticisms against the blasphemy law and said that due to misuse of this law, critics were demanding its abolition, adding that it would be better to stop the exploitation of the law rather than abolishing it.,The detailed judgement also explained how, in cases of personal enmity, people managed to drag their rivals into blasphemy cases, putting at risk the lives of the accused and all their friends and family members.,The Senate Special Committee also discussed the , and said that the charges against those arrested in the case should be reconsidered.,Recapping the case for the committee, Babar said: ""Three years ago, two churches were targeted in Youhanabad as a result of which at least 150 Christian citizens died. People in the area conducted protests to condemn the deaths of their fellow citizens — as is their right. These people were charged with terrorism and have been rotting in jail for three years."",""Terrorism charges against the people arrested should be dropped and they should be tried in civil courts,"" the committee recommended, while adding that charging innocent people with terrorism is unfair."

However, a prosecutor pointed out many lacunas and flaws in the investigation of the case in his scrutiny note apparently committed by IO to give favour to suspects. ,A couple of days after a judicial magistrate referred the case to the ATC, IO Aziz Shaikh turned up along with the charge sheet and the prosecution submitted it along with a scrutiny note before the administrative court of ATCs, Karachi. ,Public prosecutor Muzaffar Hussain Solangi in his scrutiny note observed that official weapons were unlawfully used by two ACLC policemen in the crime and it attracted Section 25 of the Sindh Arms Act, 2013, but no FIR was registered against the policemen. ,The IO neither sent the CCTV footage of the incident for forensic examination, nor collected the report of a joint investigation team, it added. ,The security note further said that the IO claimed that detained policemen confessed to have committed the offence, but he did not produce them before a judicial magistrate to record their confessional statements under Section 164 (power to record statements and confessions) of the criminal procedure code. ,Mr Solangi, who has been dealing with cases of terrorism at the administrative court of ATCs since 2015, also pointed out that Madiha Kayani was the only eyewitness of the case, but the IO did not bother to bring the suspects before the magistrate to get them identified through the eyewitness in the identification parade. ,After admitting the charge sheet, the administrative judge sent the case to ATC-13 for trial. ,Initially, the then station house officer of ACLC Tariq Mehmood; inspectors Azhar Ahsan and Tariq Raheem; head constables Ghulam Abbas, son of Niaz Ali; and Shahid and constables Ghulam Abbas, son of Ghulam Raza; Fawad Khan; Mohammad Daniyal and Bilal Rasheed were booked for allegedly killing 19-year-old student Intizar Ahmed on the night Jan 13 in Defence Housing Authority. ,However, the IO named eight officials as accused in the investigation report, but left out head constable Ghulam Abbas and contended that he was not present at the time of the incident. ,The name of Madiha Kayani, who was travelling with the victim at the time of the incident but silently disappeared from the crime scene instead of reporting it to the police, was placed among the list of prosecution witnesses. ,The IO said in the report that Daniyal and Bilal, said to be gunmen of the then SSP ACLC Muqaddas Haider, had opened fire upon the car of Intizar with pistols that caused his death. One of the bullets fired by Bilal hit the victim on one side of the head and made an exit from the other, it added. ,It further maintained in the charge sheet that Daniyal and Bilal were not the part of the ACLC team, reportedly deputed for vehicle checking in DHA, but the then SHO forgot some articles at his office and he called Bilal and then both policemen arrived at the crime scene just before the incident along the belongings of the SHO. ,Interestingly, according to Section 6.4 (d) of the Police Rules 1934, pistol/revolver can only be authorised to a gazetted officer while the charge sheet was also silent whether any standard operating procedure (SPO) was in place to arm constables with pistols. ,The charge sheet further said that the father of deceased, who is also the complainant in the case, had expressed reservations during investigations and contended that it was a planned murder and also pointed a finger at the then chief of the ACLC and others. ,However, the IO claimed in the charge sheet that the then SSP, an inspector of police and some other persons were also questioned during investigations, but nothing came on record to establish the allegations of the complainant. ,The charge sheet said that while six other ACLC officials were named as accused since they intercepted the car of the victim while donning plainclothes, committing professional negligence and fleeing from the crime scene after the incident. ,On March 7, a judicial magistrate referred the case to the administrative judge of the ATC after two prosecutors observed in the scrutiny note that the offence had created fear and insecurity among people and recommended that Sections 6/7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 be incorporated in the case and sent it to an antiterrorism court for trial. ,The public prosecutors Khair Mohammad Khattak and Abdul Qadeer Memon had initially scrutinised the investigation report and observed that the incident had created fear and insecurity among the people since the victim was unarmed and the ACLC men restored to unprovoked firing that resulted his death."

Later, a magistrate was deputed to visit the Civil Lines police station to verify doctors’ claim about their colleague’s detention. However, two smart police insp­ectors clandestinely took Dr Ishrat Mangi to the hospital by a vehicle, silently dropped him at the gate of his department and drove away, the sources said. ,At the SSP Chowk, Najamuddin Chandio, Abdul Hameed Chandio and other relatives of the deceased patient spoke to reporters and insisted that the delay in treatment was caused by Dr Mangi and, as such, he must be booked for the death of Wajid Chandio. ,They again blocked the SSP Chowk alleging that doctors at the CMCH had locked the mortuary when they shifted the body for a post-mortem examination. ,The PMA has demanded registration of an FIR against the SHO and those who attacked Dr Mangi. ,It is learnt on good authority that the Larkana district and sessions judge has called Dr Mangi to his court on Monday to record his statement. ,On his part, SHO Dharejo speaking to reporters claimed that he had brought Dr Mangi to the police station for security reasons.,Local PMA chapter and CMCH staff have demanded deployment of Rangers at and around the hospital for the safety and security of the staff."

1179,2018-03-20,The rowdy Rao Anwar,"			
,Whichever way one looks at it, former senior superintendent police (SSP) Malir, Rao Anwar, appears to be a butcher. According to a police report submitted in the Supreme Court of Pakistan, he has been accused of killing 444 people in 192 encounters between July 25, 2011 and January 19, 2018 in the Karachi district under his charge. Let that number sink in. 444. ,So when former president Asif Ali Zardari recently called him a “brave kid” on a private news channel, the backlash from people – already horrified at the brutal fashion in which a Waziristani youth had been killed allegedly by Anwar and his men – was anything but misplaced. Zardari later retracted his statement through his spokesperson, but the incident confirmed that Anwar has friends in high places. How else could a man responsible for killing nearly 500 people (or more), and declared an absconder by the country’s top court, still remain a fugitive — and be praised by a former president!,It is not just politicians who are said to have a soft spot for Anwar. Recruited in the 1980s as an assistant sub inspector, he became known for arresting and killing a number of Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) activists during a long-running security operation in Karachi between 1992 and 1999. And when the MQM came into power after the 2002 general election, Anwar got himself posted to Balochistan only to return to Karachi when the Pakistan Peoples Party assumed power in 2008. By this time, he had become even more influential. ,In April 2015, he made an explosive – but unsubstantiated – revelation in a fiery press conference against the MQM and its chief, Altaf Hussain, who, the police official said, was working on India’s behest to destroy Pakistan. The refrain sounded familiar. The army had made the same accusation back in the 1990s — when Hussain and his men were accused of carving out ‘Jinnahpur’, an autonomous state, out of Sindh. The Rangers, too, have been using the same allegations to cut the MQM’s street power down to size. Anwar has friends in very high places indeed.,But even powerful friends cannot justify young Naqeebullah Mehsud’s cold-blooded murder, allegedly at the hands of Anwar and his team of trigger-happy touts. They cannot explain how a man held responsible for killing 444 people can roam free, let alone be a policeman. They cannot explain how a policeman with a salary of less than 100,000 rupees a month can make 74 trips to Dubai since being appointed SSP (though holding the rank of an SP) and that too without completing the requisite paperwork.,A story published in the , in October 2015 narrates an anecdote: “On a March morning in 1994, a police inspector was having a nap on one of the back benches in court room number one on the second floor of the [Sindh High Court] — this is where the chief justice of the province, its highest judicial official, sits in the middle chair to adjudicate and dispense justice. Soon a court official called out the inspector’s name — Anwar Ahmed. Woken up from his slumber, he was told to present himself in front of a two-member bench of the court headed by then Sindh Chief Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid.”,That Anwar Ahmed is today’s reviled Rao Anwar. But he is not the one in need of being shaken from slumber. It is the courts, police and the state at large that need to wake up to the realisation that extrajudicial killings are not part of the solution. They are part of the problem. A problem that trigger happy police officials such as Rao Anwar, Abid Boxer and even Chaudhry Aslam could not solve by killing aspiring models, businessmen, Pakhtun labourers or, for that matter, those known to have links with extremist organisations. They all deserve a lawful treatment. No one should take the law into their own hands to inflict punishment on anyone. The ones responsible for upholding the law should be doing that – uphold the law – and not damage it for personal glory and the political and security imperatives of their friends in high places."

They should have been named for the offence of Section 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code and then let the trial court decide their fate, it added.,The scrutiny note further said it was surprising that Dr Abdul Rahim, initially believed to be among the suspects, was placed in the list of prosecution witnesses despite the fact that his rifle/shotgun was admittedly used in the offence while the relevant section was also not applied against him over illegal use of the rifle.,It maintained that as a witness Dr Rahim may damage the case of prosecution since he was not only present at the crime scene but also the main anchor and instrument for the offence as the offence took place after he was involved in a minor accident with the vehicle of the deceased.,The prosecutor further observed that the IO had not lodged a separate case against the owner of a 9mm licensed pistol, another crime weapon used in the offence, under Section 25 of Sindh Arms Act.,The investigation report said that Khawar along with his accomplices chased the victims’ Mercedes and opened indiscriminate fire on them after their vehicle had hit motorcyclist Rahim."

","			,Around 2pm one day in October 2008, a convoy of police mobiles was on its way back after visiting the scene of a murder in Moach Goth, when two young men in a white Toyota Corolla mischievously zig-zagged in front of it. ,Superintendent Police (SP) Rao Anwar, who had been promoted from the rank of DSP a month earlier, was leading the convoy. According to one of the police officials in a follow-up vehicle, Rao was furious at the ‘affront’ and ordered that the car be stopped, but the youths sped away. ,Two mobiles, on Rao’s orders, raced after the vehicle as it turned into Baldia Town. “I followed, intending to sort things out. After all, the boys hadn’t done anything criminal,” recalls the official. ,Suddenly, gunshots rang out. He soon came upon a crowd of people gathered around the Corolla; inside was the body of one of the young men he had earlier seen in the car. ,“He couldn’t have been more than 18 or 19 years old. The people there said the police had killed him. It made me think, what kind of a man can murder people in this way?”,A decade later, as details about Rao’s ‘exploits’ are coming to light, the more relevant question is, what kind of law-enforcement system nurtures men like Rao Anwar? ,What kind of law-enforcement system accommodates and protects cops like the former Malir SSP?,About a kilometre off the National Highway, inside a deserted two-room farmhouse, the light from the setting sun reflects on a wall pock-marked with bullet holes. Above them hangs a portrait of the Quaid-i-Azam. The bullet marks and a bloodstained carpet are the only evidence that remains of the murders last month. ,“Two bodies were found here, and two in the other room,” says a DSP. Among those bodies was that of Naqeebullah Mehsud, the young man whose death in a fake encounter last month led to Rao’s suspension as Senior Superintendent Police (SSP) Malir. ,			,Until Naqeebullah’s murder, Sindh’s so-called encounter specialist had not faced any inquiry over the number of encounter killings to his ‘credit’. Not a single inquiry — despite having slain at least 444 people between 2011 and 2018, according to the police’s own records. Not a single policeman was even injured, let alone killed, during the 745 encounters. ,The Rangers-led operation in Karachi, which began in late 2013, gave fresh impetus to police encounters in district Malir during Rao’s tenure. ,According to police records, Malir saw 195 police encounters from January to October 2012, in which 18 people were killed and 276 arrested; the ratio of deaths to arrests — the ‘kill rate’ — was 6.5 per cent. Between February to June 2013, the kill rate was 17.6pc. ,In 2014, after the operation began, there were 186 encounters, in which 152 people died and 192 were arrested — the kill rate a whopping 79pc. Last year, there were 93 encounters resulting in 110 deaths and 89 arrests. That translates to the number of arrests falling 23pc below the number of people killed. ,The current law enforcement system is simply not capable of telling us as to how many innocents like Naqeebullah were among those mowed down. ,“He led a team of killing machines. There was no one to stop him,” says a senior police official. “Why was no notice taken of his actions earlier? The truth is, everyone knows everything, but even the police command is afraid of him because of his close connections with criminal political bosses and within the security establishment.” ,In the words of another long-serving police official: “Men are airlifted from as far away as Fata and brought here for him to dispatch. That’s why there are so many policemen being targeted in Karachi. These are reprisal killings.” ,(In the latest case as well, other than Naqeebullah, the three men who were shot dead alongside him were also, say sources, handed over to Rao by the agencies. One of them, Mohammed Sabir, they add, was a missing person who had been picked up from Uch Sharif in southern Punjab one and a half years ago against whom no criminal record has been found.),That Pakhtun tradition of , (vengeance), according to several serving and retired police officials, is the reason why encounter killings are unknown in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa or Fata. “But the powers that be don’t care that the cops in Karachi are dying like dogs for doing their dirty work,” said a police official.,According to a source in the Sindh government, about four months ago, an awkward situation arose during a visit to the Sindh secretariat in Karachi by several military officials. Among those at the meeting was the chief secretary as well as the late Mir Hazar Khan Bijarani. The visitors included a lieutenant general, four major generals and some foreign military officials. ,“One of the generals asked the CM why the provincial government was not taking action against such a murderer. Shah Sahib ignored the question, but when another officer of the same rank later repeated the question, he finally responded, ‘It would be better for you to also ask your corps commander and the agencies,” says the source. ,			,Pakistan’s chaotic largest city is no stranger to extrajudicial killings, and Rao Anwar is not the only cop who is guilty of the odious practice. SSP Chaudhry Aslam of course was among the known practitioners of the tactic until he was killed in a suicide bombing in early 2014. ,There are a number of serving police officials that are guilty of the same, although Rao is recognised as being in a class of his own. ,According to data from the home department, aside from encounters in which Rao was involved, there were in all of Karachi , resulting in 170 deaths, down from a high of 1,719 such incidents in 2014 with 609 deaths. ,The former SSP was the head honcho of a vicious cabal, including cops and local thugs, who were part of a network extorting protection money and running a number of rackets. Anyone who crossed them or refused to pay was picked up, detained and tortured, sometimes even killed in fake encounters.,Extrajudicial killing is always justified on the grounds that the criminal justice system is too weak to deal with the level of criminality that has been rampant in the country in recent years. Proponents of this tactic argue that the entire process, from the gathering of evidence to the prosecution of the crime, is flawed and corrupted, with the result that criminals are soon back on the streets again. Witnesses who dare to give evidence put their lives in jeopardy. ,For example, after social activist Sabeen Mahmud was murdered in Karachi in April 2015, her driver Babu, who was sitting in the back seat when she was shot dead in her car, identified the killers in front of a magistrate. ,There was no one-way mirror or any kind of partition separating the suspects from Babu. ,An acquaintance of his recalls Babu later phoning him frantically, convinced he was in danger. Sure enough, he was killed on Sept 7, a few months after Sabeen’s death.,			,			,However, extrajudicial killing as an alternative to due process is no answer. “It is a slippery slope whose extreme manifestation is an individual like Rao Anwar,” says a former IG. ,We must understand that the police is a component of the overall criminal justice system. Reforms in police can’t produce the desired results unless the judiciary, prosecution, jails and other arms are also brought in line with the best norms and international practices.,Delayed decisions and corruption in the courts, corruption and lack of correctional methods in jail will nullify police reforms. One can also ask what was the need for extrajudicial killing when military courts had been set up as an extraordinary measure to deal with ‘jet black’ criminals. ,Retired IG Afzal Shigri believes that fake encounters are counter-productive for three reasons. “They are illegal, immoral and no one will come to your rescue when things change.” ,As an example, he cites the case of the policemen who had participated in the operations against the MQM in the ‘90s and then ended up being eliminated by the party’s militants when the MQM regained its hold on Karachi. ,Lawyer Faisal Siddiqi sees the reliance on extrajudicial killing as “a Hobbesian approach to restoring order. The provision of justice, or other basic services, is of no interest to the government. As the state is becoming weaker, it is becoming more authoritarian.”,After years of operating with impunity, young Naqeebullah’s cold-blooded murder was the catalyst for Rao’s activities coming in for long overdue scrutiny. However, as far as he is concerned, he is still above the law. ,After refusing to cooperate with the inquiry committee set up to probe the deaths of Naqeebullah, Rao disappeared. ,(The three-man team included Additional IG CTD Sindh Sanaullah Abbasi, DIG South Azad Khan, and also his immediate boss DIG East Sultan Khawaja under whose command district Malir falls.) His inner circle of 15 to 20 policemen, including his nephew Rao Amir, has also vanished, seemingly without a trace. ,On Tuesday, the Supreme Court granted protective bail to Rao; he has been ordered to appear in court today. ,The inquiry report established Naqeebullah’s innocence. He was not a former TTP commander nor involved in the Dera Ismail Khan jailbreak nor a gunman of Baitullah Mehsud, as Rao has alleged. The document also contains some notable details; for example, the post-mortem points out that Naqeebullah was shot twice in the back. ,Among the appendices attached to the report is a statement by the station investigation officer, Inspector Nasrullah, newly appointed to the Shah Latif Town police station within whose limits the murder occurred. The SIO’s account exposes a sordid cover-up by the SHO Shah Latif Town Amanullah Marwat, who has also since disappeared. ,The SIO has said that when he tried to probe deeper into the ‘encounter’ he was threatened that he too would be bumped off in a similar fashion if he didn’t step back. The security risks are such that the inquiry committee in its recommendations suggested that the witnesses be provided protection under the Sindh Witness Protection Act 2013. ,Rao enjoyed a nearly seven-year long tenure as SSP Malir (punctuated with some gaps), not to mention several preceding years in the same district, completely contrary to police rules. Even now, the locals are so terrified that no one, other than Naqeebullah’s family, is willing to speak on the record about their experience at his hands. ,The fear runs so deep that the family of two brothers who were picked up and allegedly killed in a staged encounter refused to speak with , even though they have since moved out of Sohrab Goth. They are convinced that elements of the deep state that have protected him all along will protect him even now, said a local. ,Moreover, Rao not only oversaw the ‘police encounters’ of so-called jet-black terrorists handed to him. He was the head honcho of a vicious cabal, including cops and local thugs, who were part of a network extorting protection money and running a number of rackets, including land-grabbing, sand and gravel (reti bajri) lifting for the construction business, smuggling of Iranian petrol, vice dens, narcotics and illegal water hydrants. ,Anyone who crossed them or refused to pay was picked up, detained and tortured, sometimes even killed in fake encounters. ,A police official who is well acquainted with the former SP’s activities says: “Rao was running a multi-billion rupee criminal empire from his office in Malir. The district was his fiefdom. There was a team under him who located the people, taking one lakh from one, Rs15 lakh from another, dispatching some. It was total lawlessness.”,According to a mid-level cop posted at a Malir police station, who has also worked with Rao, money was the motive why Naqeebullah was picked up. “Rao’s touts amongst the Sohrab Goth shopkeepers came to know that Naseem was in possession of a hefty amount of money with which he wanted to buy a shop,” he said. ,“Two policemen — SI Yaseen Dhukku and ASI Akbar Mallah — picked him up along with two of his friends from a restaurant on Abul Hassan Ispahani road. While they let his friends go, they continued to torture him even after extracting Rs9 million, demanding he pay them Rs20m more. By then, he was in such bad shape that they decided it would be unwise to set him free.”,Interestingly, while the top cops investigating the Malir cases remained tight-lipped, the head of the shopkeepers’ association in the Sohrab Goth market has also gone missing.,A DSP posted in Malir also alleges there are farmhouses in Gadap, Memon Goth and Gulshan-e-Maymar where Rao and his henchmen detained people, up to 40 at one location. “Heaven knows what has become of them in the last few weeks since Rao and his team have been on the run.”,It is a measure of Rao’s clout that — barring only one occasion in the past — even when he had been suspended as SSP, an official of his choice was appointed to his post to keep his seat warm. The stand-in used to be Dr Mohammed Najeeb Khan, SP Malir, who after Rao’s reinstatement would revert to his previous position as SP. ,Even the Sindh chief minister was helpless before a policeman who knew he was more powerful than even the province’s top executive. After being suspended for arresting MQM leader Izharul Hassan, he challenged his suspension in court. He was reinstated a few weeks later. ,No one seems to doubt that SSP Adeel Chandio, a well-reputed officer who has been posted in Rao’s place, wants to weed out the corruption in Malir police. (Although Rao was technically an SP, he had been given an SSP’s charge — another perk of being an instrument of the deep state.) “I hold an open kachehri for two hours every day,” says SSP Adeel. “So firstly, I’m making the SSP’s office more accessible to the public, and secondly I won’t allow illegal activities in my area that harm either the government or the people”. ,To that end, he says, he had 55 police personnel transferred out immediately since he came in, including all the SHOs in Malir. ,(District Malir is the largest of Karachi’s six districts and has 12 police stations. However, four police stations in district East and one in district West also fall under the SSP Malir’s jurisdiction, making for a total of 17.),			,However, clawing back control over the district requires far more than shuffling of police personnel. According to a senior police official, “Rao had a lot of ingress in Malir because he was posted there for so many years. His tentacles are all over the place. We don’t know who is working for him.”,Two cops that met , on its recce deep inside Malir explained that the former SSP’s touts continue to act as informants, keeping tabs on people’s movements. “It will take SSP Chandio some time to understand the extent of Rao’s network,” says one of them. “Don’t forget, he also inspired fierce loyalty in this area. After all, they were all beneficiaries to some extent. Some of his close associates in the police are still well placed in the police.” ,His colleague adds with a chuckle: “It’s like getting the cat to watch the cream.” Take for instance, Inspector Irfanullah Bangash who, say the local cops, oversees the sand and gravel mining racket in the dry riverbed of Malir river. ,Rao Anwar’s role in facilitating land-grabbing in an area where the sprawling gated communities of Bahria Town Karachi — at the behest of the Sindh PPP’s top bosses — and DHA City Karachi — to curry favour with the powers that be — are coming up, is well known.  His name and that of SHO Khan Nawaz, aside from certain retired military officials, are mentioned repeatedly by the many villagers who have been or are under threat of being evicted from the land they have farmed for generations. ,Less known however, even though it has been around for much longer, is his stake in sand and gravel mining, a business so lucrative that it is termed sona reti, or gold sand. The activity has led to environmental devastation by lowering the water table to critical levels in many parts of the district and laying waste to what was once verdant farmland. Given that Malir is Karachi’s green belt, the implications for the city as a whole are dire. ,The landscape of Malir’s Shah Latif Town where lifting of , is particularly common, has been permanently altered. Deep, humongous canyons have appeared in several places, the earth gouged out over the years by tens of thousands of excavators and dumpers. ,These areas are known as ,. Every evening, from 8 or 9pm until dawn, queues of dumpers line up near each ,; excavation machines remove the soil and transfer it to the dumpers that then transport it to holding areas or ‘stocks’ to be sold onward to various building sites. It takes up to five to six minutes to fill one dumper. Friday is the day off. ,According to Asmatullah Khan, who was until recently involved in , mining himself, and local cops speaking to , on condition of anonymity, the contractors and middlemen in the business — largely from the Pakhtun community — number in the thousands. ,Each contractor pays the police up to Rs20,000 per night per dumper, regardless of the number of trips during the hours of work; there can be 100 dumpers removing earth from each dhakka per night. ,			,Until Rao was suspended, ‘beaters’ attached with each police station collected the money that went straight to him and his political bosses. Policemen working the range were, according to their rank, also among the beneficiaries. Some local politicians took their cut too. “Each police station that falls in SSP Malir’s jurisdiction makes between Rs400,000 to Rs500,000 per night,” says Mr Khan. “And that’s a conservative estimate. So you can imagine what Rao used to rake in.”,Section 144 on the lifting of sand and gravel in Malir district has been in force since years. But with the district and the law-enforcement officials themselves the principal beneficiaries of the racket, who was there to prevent the ravaging of public land in the area?,Sources in the police say that the incoming SSP Malir has put a stop to the reti bajri work, but local cops insist that unbeknown to him, it is not entirely suspended; the gains far outweigh the risk. , did come across some dhakkas where fresh tyre treads and excavator shovel marks are clearly visible.,			,The smuggling of Iranian petrol has been yet another lucrative source of income. An SP in district West explains why, against all logic, four police stations in district East — Sohrab Goth, Site, Sachal and Mobina Town — fall under the jurisdiction of SSP district Malir; so does Gulshan-i-Maymar in district West. “If you look on a map, the location of the five police stations forms a corridor from Hub through Malir to the east through which the smuggling can carry on unimpeded.,It is not that Malir police is alone in its criminal pursuits — far from it. However, in Rao’s case, that avarice is coupled with an utter disregard for human life, which is precisely what makes him such a useful instrument for the powers that be.,			,Police authorities have disclosed that Rao made 74 trips to Dubai since he was appointed SSP Malir. That works out to almost one trip every month, a lifestyle that his salary of around Rs95,000 could scarcely have supported. ,Rao did not only derive his power from being the blue-eyed boy of the establishment, but also from his close connections with VVIPs in Sindh’s political landscape. He was first elevated out of turn to SP less than a fortnight after Asif Zardari was sworn in as president.,A senior source in the Sindh government confirmed that on no occasion had Rao even sought ex-Pakistan leave — which is mandatory for government employees — to proceed abroad. ,It is also worth questioning how FIA Karachi Airport under Deputy Director, Asim Qaimkhani, (FIA) posted as SSP in Sindh police until four years ago, could let him exit the country without the requisite paperwork. Instead, Rao’s stint as SHO Airport thana meant that Jinnah International, with its khepias smuggling in all manner of contraband, held no surprises for him. Besides, the airport is located in district Malir.,Meanwhile, , has also unearthed some details about Rao in Dubai. His , is issued to him as the , of his wife, Samina Anwar Ahmed Khan, and bars him from doing business in the Emirates. ,Their three children — a son and two daughters — also legally live with her. Mrs Khan is described as a partner with Amar Ahmed Khan in the Dubai-based AAA Trading Company that should ostensibly deal in food and beverages but does no business. ,Rao did not only derive his power from being the blue-eyed boy of the establishment, but also from his close connections with VVIPs in Sindh’s political landscape. He was first elevated from Inspector to Deputy Superintendent Police in March 2008 and six months later to SP on Sep 18, 2008, less than a fortnight after Asif Zardari was sworn in as president. (The out of turn promotion was reversed in July 2013 by a court order.),One interesting anecdote illustrates the extent to which even officials senior to him in the police hierarchy would defer to Rao. A police contingent from Clifton raided an apartment belonging to a businessman who is now a senior PTI leader. The gentleman in question was with three sitting DIGs. ,When the senior officials protested, the police party told them to contact Rao who told them bluntly that the individual had no choice but to go with the police. At this, the DIGs — two ranks senior to Rao at the time — asked the Clifton police to at least wait until they left the premises.,Nevertheless, however one looks at it, the buck stops with IG Sindh A.D Khowaja. As a result of the relentless campaign waged by civil society activists in the belief that Mr Khowaja can bring some order to policing in Sindh, the Supreme Court recently restored to him the power to transfer and post senior police officials in the province. The Sindh government had stripped him of that authority in order to hobble him so that their criminality in land matters, over sugar mills and in voter manipulation, etc could continue without hindrance. ,While acknowledging that in many ways this present IG is an improvement on his predecessors, those in the know say that he has made many “compromises” with the province’s top bosses. According to a Sindh government official, “When the IG undertakes transfers and postings, he consults the CM, although he doesn’t need to. Thus he didn’t remove the SP Malir, nor the SSPs of Jamshoro, Khairpur, Larkana and Nawabshah, all the districts that are the PPP’s strongholds. All other SSPs were transferred.”,The case of SSP Jamshoro, Irfan Bahadur, is particularly interesting.  Mr Bahadur was away for almost a year in the UK, while waiting to obtain a Tier 2 visa with his wife as the principal applicant. Despite his long absence from duty, he was, immediately upon his return, appointed SSP Jamshoro. ,The Sindh government source divulged that it was Malik Riaz, chairman of Bahria Town, and close associate of Mr Zardari, “who had had Irfan Bahadur appointed to Jamshoro when he was expanding Bahria Town Karachi into that district.” Such is the wheeling and dealing that has made Sindh police the handmaiden of a predatory state.,Villages have been raided by police in the middle of the night, the men beaten, taken away and booked under false charges or threatened with being killed in staged encounters if they didn’t surrender their land. Not long ago a group of locals spoke with , about how Rao’s police have helped Bahria Town thugs terrorise the villagers.,“Bahria has been after us since 2008. They bulldozed the four wells on my family’s farm and destroyed it. And police mobiles with covered number plates gave them protection,” said Zarina Jokhio, her voice shaking with rage. “Where do we go for help if the police and local MPAs pay no heed to us?”,Meanwhile, what is likely to happen to the former SSP? Even now, says a senior police official, those concerned “aren’t interested in prosecuting him. Their intention was only to remove him. The police, agencies, politicians have 100pc planned on getting him off scot-free.” ,Arguably though, Rao may have become a liability. Knowing too much can be dangerous.,

Since then the whereabouts of the former police officer had been unknown.,Observers were of the opinion that his ‘mysterious appearance’ was the result of intense back-channel efforts and in-camera briefings during the past few days that helped in identification of those who facilitated his attempt to leave for Dubai from the Islamabad airport on Jan 23.,Naqeebullah Mehsud — whose name was given as Naseemullah on his national identity card — was a shop owner fond of modelling, relatives of the deceased had told Dawn.,Hailing from South Waziristan, he was among four suspects killed in an 'encounter' with a police team headed by Anwar in the Usman Khaskheli Goth on the outskirts of the metropolis in January 2018.,Anwar had alleged that Naqeebullah was a Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militant, but a later statement reportedly issued by a spokesperson for TTP's South Waziristan chapter had termed the claim ""baseless"", clarifying that the deceased had no links with the banned militant outfit.,Naqeebullah's family had also disputed Anwar's claim, saying that the 27-year-old had no links with any militant organisation.,In January, an inquiry team of senior police officers probing the alleged extrajudicial killing of Mehsud had found that the Waziristan native was killed in a fake encounter which was staged by then-SSP Malir Anwar on January 13.,The high-level inquiry committee had also concluded in its initial report submitted to the Sindh police that the deceased man had no militant tendencies."

","ISLAMABAD: The Sindh police conceded before the Supreme Court on Wednesday that the mysterious murder of Perween Rehman, the director of the Orangi Pilot Project (OPP), Karachi, was the result of a conspiracy hatched by those threatened by her efforts against land grabbing and her championing of the Goth Abad scheme. ,The report of the , the March 13, 2013 murder of Ms Rehman, was furnished by Deputy Inspector Gen­eral of West Zone, Karachi, Amir Farooqi before a three-judge bench headed by Justice Sheikh Azmat Saeed. ,The interim report stated that the linking of Qazi Bilal, believed to be a senior commander of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan who was reportedly killed in a police encounter on March 14, 2013 — a day after the murder of Ms Rehman — with the murder as prime suspect was in all probability false. ,Report disputes police claim that OPP director was killed by a Taliban ‘commander’,Ms Rehman was going home from her office when unidentified assailants approached her car on a motorcycle on Manghopir Road near Banaras Flyover and opened fire. She , and was rushed to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital by her driver where she died. ,Advocate Raheel Kamran Sheikh, appearing on behalf of Aquila Ismail, Ms Rehman’s sister, expressed his confidence over the interim report by stating that the JIT was heading in the right direction but expressed the apprehension that its composition might be changed in future. ,However, Additional Advo­cate General for Sindh Shaharyar assured the court that the composition of the JIT would not be changed. ,The JIT report contended that the JIT found the accounts of Sub-Inspector Ashfaq Baloch and former SHO of Peerabad police station Abdul Moeed about , simply unbelievable. ,According to the report, Qari Bilal was probably killed over an internal dispute between Taliban factions but his body was subsequently picked up by the two police officials who claimed that he was killed in an encounter. ,Other police staff conceded that Abdul Moeed was considered to be personal staff officer of District West SSP Asif Ijaz Sheikh and was more powerful than any other police functionary in the district, the report stated, adding that it would have been easy for him to manipulate the collection of evidence, for instance changing the spent bullet casings collected to ensure that they matched. ,It said that Ashfaq Baloch had a patchy professional record and had been previously involved in professional missteps. ,While Baloch lied about the facts of the encounter in which Qari Bilal was said to be killed, he was not involved in a wider manipulation. ,The JIT held former SI Abdul Moeed as an officer who enjoyed extremely bad reputation both in terms of integrity and professionalism. Currently, he has been dismissed from police service over some other matter and also facing a murder charge in an unrelated case. ,According to the report, the JIT was of the opinion that Moeed most likely did play a central role in the manipulation of evidence, but there was no evidence on record to prove this. ,The JIT admitted that the ‘real investigation’ into the death of Ms Rehman began three years after her murder, and due to the lapse of time, it was difficult to gather technical evidence that would have assisted in the investigation. ,While concluding, the report said the JIT needed to examine the context of a wider motive behind the murder before submission of a final report to try to find a concrete link between the work that Ms Rehman was doing and the elements or forces that were most affected and impacted by her efforts. ,The court then ordered the JIT to submit the final report by April 24.

They lack capacity and even facilities to scientifically collect evidence. How one could expect the proving of the terrorism charges by an investigation officer, who has just intermediate qualification,” said an official of the prosecution department.,He believed that it was important to have a trained and highly qualified or trained police officer to collect evidence, which was the basis of the entire case.,“Rs620 is still the entire expenditure for the investigation. How you can expect a quality investigation with it,” he said talking about different factors affecting the collection of evidence and quality of investigation.,Another official wondered if a witness had no security, how he or she could expect that the crimes would be proved.,He said after a terrorist blew himself up, it was hard to collect scientific evidence.,“Our investigation is very weak. We need good forensic laboratories. Our investigators are not law graduate or highly qualified and so, such basis of a case is weak one and difficult to prove a case,” he said.,According to the report, of the 1,100 investigation officers, only 37 are presently working with counter terrorism department, who lack interviewing skills and often fail to connect the accused to his or her accomplice and they do not make sufficient use of modern investigation techniques, including collection of forensic evidence from crime scene.,The report also adds that at the time of registration of First Information Report in terrorism cases, the suspect is not known to the police neither are witnesses identified and hence, paradoxically, this often results in weakened cases.,The police, prosecution and judges working on anti-terrorism cases lack a sound appreciation of confession as it is seen by all as most conclusive evidence but in practice, it is very common that the accused changes or deny their confession at the stage of trial. The confessions should not prevent investigators from finding another fragments of evidence to strengthen the case, suggested the committee, which analysed the cases.,It also said even in the anti-terrorism courts, the case writing should improve.,The committee called for immurement in the wording of the arguments from both sides, the differentiation of cases between anti-terrorism and ordinary, the decisiveness of the relief, the sentencing parameters and the status of absconders – when pronouncing judgment against the accused.,The study’s report recommended to train the police personnel working on counter terrorism on efficient crime scene management in terrorism cases, prevent contamination of crime scenes, post-terrorist incidents, train the police in evidence collection, guide the stakeholders in interpretation of investigative techniques and reports of judicial proceedings and maintaining records starting from FIR.,The report also recommended the strengthening of the supervision of police investigators in terrorism cases and improvement of the judgment writing in anti-terrorism cases to increase the understanding of verdicts.

One TV report suggested that he is being kept in his own house in Malir Cantonment but there is no confirmation.,Reporters and TV viewers were amazed at the manner in which Rao Anwar came to the Supreme Court.,The two-and-a-half-month saga began when a young man from Waziristan, trying to eke out a living in Karachi, was picked up while entertaining a couple of friends over a cup of tea in Karachi’s Sohrab Goth area in early January this year. Some 10 days later, , with the police.,Police, most notably, Rao Anwar had dubbed Naqeebullah a Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan militant but when the young Mehsud’s friends and family took to the social media and then the streets to dispute the claim and also spell out how he was picked up before being killed some 10 days later, a storm started to brew.,Young Pakhtun activists protested vociferously and the government, the police force and also the country’s highest court took notice after it became apparent what had actually transpired. With the statements of the two friends, who’d been picked up with Mehsud but, thankfully, released, it appeared like an open-and-shut case.,Rao Anwar disappeared from public view and the next one heard of him was when he tried but , due to a watchful FIA (Immigration) official who refused him permission to travel because his paper work was not in order. This was towards the end of January.,Even when he made the abortive attempt to leave the country, it was reported in the media that he arrived at the airport in the company of plainclothesmen who got his boarding card and completed the check-in on his behalf. Yet, nothing was confirmed.,Some two months later, that day’s events at Islamabad airport became the main reason the absconding police official finally resurfaced to face at least a bit of the music. Reporter Azaz Syed says when the Supreme Court asked police and intelligence agencies on more than one occasion to find and produce Rao Anwar they continued to dodge the issue.,However, when the ,, resistance started to weaken and CCTV evidence appeared which led to (via the Nadra database) the identification of the agency personnel who’d accompanied the police officer to the airport some 10 days after the murder of Naqeebullah Mehsud and in their supreme self-confidence made no effort to hide their faces.,It was after this development that Rao Anwar’s protectors were left with no option but to facilitate his surrender. But, sources suggest, there was still some negotiations on the terms of surrender including a fresh joint investigation team to probe the Naqeebullah case, even though the police had registered a case after an earlier Sindh police JIT.,Therefore, when he finally arrived at the Supreme Court a little over two month and a few hearings after the young Mehsud was gunned down, it appears everyone was ready for him. One hopes and prays the Supreme Court’s interest in this case will ensure that justice is dispensed.,But can one also hope that the larger issue of forced disappearances and summary executions also be addressed? I, for one, am not optimistic. The Supreme Court is right to focus its attention on the government’s shortcomings in various areas of concern to the common man. There, however, seems to be no commitment or effort on the part of any institution to undertaking judicial reform which is the only route to ensuring the provision of justice at a very basic level and protecting the life and liberty of citizens.,And, when viewed against the battle the country is waging against terrorist groups, the legislative and judicial framework appears wholly inadequate. Where extrajudicial killings and disappearances are, and should be, repugnant and unacceptable in any civilised society, the system finds itself incapable of prosecuting and sentencing those guilty of heinous crimes.,Here lies my worry and concern. One Rao Anwar can be taken out of commissioning for a while perhaps but the pressure and, to some warped minds, the rationale remains to ‘take out’ those considered guilty. Such a situation and attitude will always lead to bloody miscarriages of justice.,Regardless of ,, pledges to dispense justice, and declarations of a commitment to the common man, without meaningful reform we will always be waiting for the next Naqeebullah Mehsud. , "

He said the number of the missing persons was alarmingly increasing. It was 116 just in month of February 2018, showing four persons were disappearing every day. ,He said these missing persons were reported to the Commission of Inquiry for Enforced Disappearances. ,The number of missing persons was even higher because not all the cases were reported to the commission. All the rights activists, including Hina Jilani and I.A. Rehman, were concerned over the increasing number of the missing persons, he said. ,Mr Haq added that the movement of the academics against the enforced disappearances was moving on, expecting a large number of more teachers to sign the petition. ,The petition addressed to the president, prime minister, chief justice and chief of the army staff says: “We, the undersigned, are deeply distressed by what appears to be official policy to rely upon the practice of enforced disappearance as a means of stifling dissent and narrowing the bounds of allowable speech in Pakistan. The prevalence of this practice is gauged by 1,532 pending cases with the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances at the beginning of 2018. ,“As teachers and academics, we are concerned that the practice of enforced disappearance is being used to generate fear, insecurity and paranoia amongst the very people who are the creative and intellectual lifeblood of our nation. By disappearing people who raise their voices for a collective conscience, thriving cultures of critical debate are also being silenced, to the detriment of all Pakistanis”."

","			,ORLANDO: The US government has revealed that the Pulse nightclub shooter’s father was a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) informant for 11 years before the attack, lawyers for his widow said on Monday.,They said prosecutors told them in an email on Saturday that the government found evidence on the day of the attack that , father, Seddique Mateen, had been sending money to Afghanistan and Turkey, and that he was accused of raising money to fund violence against the government of Pakistan.,Noor Salman’s lawyers say that this new information shared only after prosecutors rested their case should result in a mistrial or an outright dismissal of the charges against her. She is accused of helping her husband plan the ,, where he killed 49 people.,Her lawyers say the government’s belated disclosure has prevented them from exploring the possibilities that Mateen was more directly involved, and that Ms Salman may have been framed to hide the government’s mistakes. It is clear that the federal government’s failure to disclose these details was to keep her from getting a fair trial, her attorneys said.,The government’s “violations in this case have placed Ms Salman, the jury, and the court in a dark wood where the search for truth has been thwarted,” they wrote.,Her lawyers’ federal court motion, which was filed on Monday, said that US Attorney Sara Sweeney sent them an email on Saturday revealing some details of the FBI’s involvement with and knowledge of Mateen’s activities leading up to the Pulse attack. “I have just received authorisation to disclose the following information about Mateen,” her email said, adding that “he was a FBI confidential human source at various points in time between January 2005 and June 2016”.,This email was sent after jurors heard Shahla Mateen deny during cross-examination that her husband had any relationship with the FBI.,The email also revealed other details the prosecution didn’t tell jurors before resting its case against Ms Salman, including the discovery in the hours after the shooting that “receipts for money transfers to Turkey and Afghanistan” made in the days and weeks before the shooting were found at Mateen’s home, and that in 2012, an anonymous tipster had accused him of “seeking to raise $50,000 — $100,000 via a donation drive to contribute towards an attack against the government of Pakistan”.,Defence attorneys say the failure to share this information in advance of her trial violates Ms Salman’s Fifth Amendment right to due process and Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial, because her defence would have investigated “whether Mateen’s father was involved in or had foreknowledge of the Pulse attack,” they wrote.,Prosecutors told the jury that Ms Salman knew Omar Mateen was buying rounds of ammunition for his AR-15, helped him spend thousands of dollars before the attack and knew about his plan when he left their home in the hours before the shooting. They also say she lied, tried to mislead FBI agents and had knowledge of her husband’s sick fascination with violent jihadist videos and terrorism.,But defense attorneys describe Ms Salman as a simple woman with a low IQ, who was abused emotionally, mentally and physically by her husband. This latest evidence, they say, points instead to Mateen’s father as a potential accomplice.,“Alternatively, the FBI’s purported interviews with Ms Salman were directed to evading the negligence they exercised with their own informant,” the motion says, and “to finding an additional culprit rather than their own informant”.,Former federal prosecutor David S. Weinstein agreed that if the defence had this information about Mateen’s father before trial, they could have planted doubt in the minds of jurors that Ms Salman was ever involved. The defense began presenting its case on Monday, and at this point the judge will likely keep the trial going while he evaluates the motion, he said.,Ahmed Bedier, president of the civil rights advocacy group United Voices, has been attending the trial in support of Ms Salman. He said her family had suspected Mateen might have been working with the FBI, but they lacked evidence to support this. Mr Bedier also noted that when Mateen was interviewed by the FBI in 2013 and not charged with false statements or any other crime, it enabled him to legally secure the firearms he used in the Pulse attack.,“They chose to protect their own informant and their own connection to Omar Mateen,” Bedier said. “The fact that his father was an informant for 11 years, and the FBI interviewed him in 2013, there’s suspicion now that it’s because of the father that the government closed that case.”,As for Mateen, the government had listed him as a potential witness in February, but did not make him testify before resting its case. The wording of the Saturday email, cited by the defense in its motion, suggests the government still doesn’t want him to talk too much in front of the jury: “If you should call S. Mateen to the stand, the government will not seek to elicit any of this information from him,” Ms Sweeney wrote."

The police came up with a claim that the deceased was an accomplice of the held bandits. However, they withdrew that version after Maqsood’s family reached the hospital and shared the true story with the media.,It transpired that he was travelling with his rickshaw driver friend, Abdul Rauf, when the firing started and he had nothing to do with the bandits and the encounter. ,New findings reveal Maqsood was killed by police firing as bandits were unarmed,Although the police authorities declared him innocent, they came up with another claim that the victim was actually killed by the held bandits who attacked the police but the rickshaw was hit in the crossfire.,This version of the police also turned out to be a bundle of lies when the consistent effort of Maqsood’s family, who were supported by civil society, led to a fresh investigation into the incident.,Finally, after more than a month-long process the truth came out putting a question mark on the city police force, which appears to have become more aggressive in engaging fleeing suspects in ‘encounters’.,“So far, it appears to be a point-blank murder by the men in uniform [policemen],” said an official while sharing the findings of the fresh probe. “The investigation was transferred to DIG West Amir Farooqi by the Sindh IG on a new FIR registered on the complaint of Maqsood’s father which alleged that the police party was involved in his murder and that the claim that he was killed by dacoit is not correct.”,Unarmed bandits ,During the course of the fresh probe, he said, the investigators found several discrepancies in the statements of policemen who took part in the encounter.

The dots were connected and within a few days the investigation was clear that Maqsood and Rauf were not hit by dacoits’ firing. ,“Ali Eidain, the arrested bandit, actually told the investigation team that they were not armed. However, this fact was not corroborated through any other independent source or evidence. Finally the team got the CCTV [closed-circuit television] cameras’ footage that exposed each and every aspect of the story.”,The official said that arrested suspects Babar and Eidain were professional criminals and had a history of such activities and were also wanted by the Punjab police for several cases registered in Lahore and Multan. The police party which took part in the “encounter” was genuinely looking for them and acting on a tip-off they intercepted them on main Sharea Faisal.,“But the way the policemen fired on Rauf and Maqsood was totally unwarranted and unnecessary. The dacoits had surrendered before the police party and they were unarmed. Indiscriminate firing at the rickshaw without confirming the identity [of the occupants] is simply barbaric. It is a miracle that Murtaza and Rauf survived,” said the official.,‘Murder in broad daylight’  ,The family of Maqsood and rights activists demand transparent and smooth probe into the case accusing police of “committing murder in broad daylight”.,Accompanied by social activist and lawyer Jibran Nasir, they told media that the charge sheet filed by the police in court had revealed many things.,“Police have committed a murder in broad daylight. We demand CCTV footage of the incident be made public,” Mr Nasir said, claiming the CCTV footage clearly showed that there was no attempt by the robbers to stop the rickshaw.,“The robbers reportedly pretended that their vehicle had been in an accident and on the pretext of rushing to the hospital they tried to get away on the rickshaw Maqsood had been travelling in,” said Nasir. “The police then chased the rickshaw in a private car and cornered it, dragged the men out, sat them on road and shot them. We demand the bail given to police officials involved in the case be cancelled and a case should be registered against them under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA).” "

It is thus a critical issue for every citizen and silence over it in Punjab is mind boggling,” says Asim Sajjad Akhter, Punjab president of the Awami Workers Party (AWP) how has been leading protests against enforced disappearances across the country. ,“The difference between this protest and the last one is that the people from across the country have gathered here in Lahore, which means the pain of those families, who are losing dear ones to enforced disappearances, is now being felt by more and more people,” he added. ,Farooq Tariq, central spokesman for the AWP, said Dr Bakhshal Thalho and Ustad Mir Muhammad Ali Talpur addressed the protest from Sindh while Manzoor Pashteen of Pashtun Tahafuz Movement did that from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. ,“We demand the state make public the report of 2010 Judicial Commission and Criminalise Enforced Disappearances. Either present legal charges against the disappeared in the court of law or let them go back to their families whose lives have been made an agony,” Asim Sajjad said and added: “No threats are grave enough to justify enforced disappearances as a state policy. Our judicial system is robust enough to deal with legitimate threats through the procedural justice. Without recourse to due process of law, forcibly disappeared become political prisoners and prisoners of conscience.” "

","PESHAWAR: When Ziaullah Hamdard appeared before the Joint Investigation Team to record his statement in Mashal Khan’s murder case, he would quote from the holy Quran when he spoke to people or policemen. ,Those who know him are aware that Hamdard has a religious background. Not one to wear that badge on his sleeve, he went out of the way to dispel doubts — real or perceived — about his religious credentials. ,How else does one validate the legitimacy of one’s faith to finger-pointing mobs that see those supporting someone accused of blasphemy as being guilty of the same act? ,How does one save oneself from the murderous stain that bled in the corridors of Abdul Wali Khan University, Mardan, on April 13 last year? , but the witnesses to his murder, and his family, live in fear. ,Now that their testimonies have ,, they face consequences in a milieu where religio-political parties and religious groups that protest convictions openly incite hatred against those seeking justice for Mashal. ,The last time we met, Hamdard was in a small dank room inside a police complex in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The room belonged to police guards and an elderly bearded man in plain clothes sat sentinel by the door. ,Hamdard looked thin, pale and manic from lack of light and sleep. There were bugs in the bed and as we spoke, a rat rattled the contents of a drawer in a table. It was the kind of room you couldn’t bring enough light to, the kind where gloom clung to walls, floor and roof like soot. A lone bulb hanging at its centre did little to dispel it. This was the only room police had for him when he asked for security after receiving threats. ,The Supreme Court had asked the provincial government to provide security to witnesses. Even when he feared going out to community bathrooms, uneasy at the prospect of being among unknown men who could potentially harm him, Hamdard was grateful for the room, the two guards and the vehicle provided to him to move around. ,A lecturer at the Abdul Wali Khan University, Mardan, and a key witness in Mashal Khan’s murder, no one at the police station knew who Hamdard was. ,Yet in a country where the governor of the federation’s most powerful province was killed by his guard for defending a woman accused of blasphemy, he said, nowhere was safe, not even Police Lines. ,And yet, people at the Police Lines must have known who he was, for he spoke frequently on TV about Mashal Khan’s case. The police had cautioned him against it. But his statements in the case — turned controversial by obfuscation of facts by the university administration, a smear campaign against Mashal Khan on social media and support for his murderers by religious and political parties — were critical to establish culpability of the accused. ,Hamdard, who was there in the midst of events leading to Mashal’s murder, had resigned in protest from the university for accusing the youth of blasphemy. ,“I had the facts first hand, I knew the university administration was involved [in instigating the murder] and using blasphemy as a bogey to hide behind.” ,The ,. He said that 80 per cent of the JIT report was based on his statements and his court testimony had got one suspect imprisoned for life. ,“Speaking to the police and people during that time, I would recite the holy Quran so much, I came to memorise half of it,” says Hamdard. “It was the only way I could ensure that people think of me as a practising Muslim because the clergy had painted witnesses and supporters of Mashal as blasphemers too.” ,In this, Hamdard is not alone. Such is the threat and threat perception among those related to the case, even Mashal’s family take pains to provide testimonials to his religious beliefs and theirs. ,“Soon after Mashal’s lynching, everyone stood by the killers who are from influential families,” he says. “No one stood up for Mashal, Abdullah and Zubair [the two students accused of blasphemy alongside Mashal].” ,Abdullah, who fled to Saudi Arabia, couldn’t afford travel expenses. A police official and a politician had donated money to get him out. ,“Mashal’s murder has left many at the mercy of people who celebrate and glorify killers. As a result of the state’s policies, intellect, wisdom and creativity are dying as the society slides towards darkness.” ,Security concerns keep him moving, frequently changing locations. Both Abdullah and Zubair have gone underground. Mashal’s sisters have abandoned education, their house guarded by police. They will live with this threat for the rest of their lives, says Hamdard, marked for having stood up for an innocent man murdered in the name of blasphemy."

Asma will not be forgotten.” ,Monday's report also took aim at religious bigotry and the government's refusal to push back against religious zealots, fearing a backlash. ,“The people's right to socio-economic activities is curtailed by intolerance and extremism and authorities are lenient for fear of political backlash,” said the report. ,It added that religious conservative organisations continued to resist laws aimed at curbing violence against women, laws giving greater rights to women and removing legal restrictions on social exchanges between sexes, which remain segregated in many parts of the Pakistani society. ,The report pointed out that in 2017 instances of violence against women was much higher than the actual cases reported, whereas 12m women in the country have still not been registered to vote for the upcoming general election. ,Still, there was legal progress in other areas, it noted, describing as a “landmark development” a new law in Punjab, which accepts marriage licences within the Sikh community at the local level, giving the unions protection under the law. ,But religious minorities in Pakistan continued to be a target of extremists, it said, citing attacks on Shias, Christians falsely accuse of blasphemy and also on Ahmedis. ,“In a year when freedom of thought, conscience and religion continued to be stifled, incitement to hatred and bigotry increased, and tolerance receded even further,” said the report. ,On Sunday in Quetta, gunmen attacked Christian worshippers as they left Sunday services, killing two. Five other worshippers were wounded, two seriously. ,Last year was a troubling year for activists, journalists and bloggers.,Several were detained, including five bloggers who subsequently fled the country after their release. From exile, some of them said their captors were agents of an intelligence agency.,In December, Raza Mehmood Khan, an activist who worked with schoolchildren on both sides of the border to foster better relations was picked up by several men after leaving a meeting that criticised religious extremism. ,Last year, a government-mandated commission on enforced disappearances received 868 new cases, more than in two previous years. The commission located 555 of the disappeared but the remaining 313 are still missing. ,“Journalists and bloggers continue to sustain threats, attacks and abductions and blasphemy law serves to coerce people into silence,” the report said."

1310,2018-04-17,"What everyone is missing about the Tayyaba case
","I want to share the good news first: social media activism works. The proof of this is the pictures circulating on social media of Tayyaba, the child maid allegedly tortured in Islamabad, which led to the , notice taken by the Supreme Court. ,It is heartening to see the various kinds of activisms that made this happen. The civic activism of the neighbours who first filed the complaint, the social media and mainstream media activism that maintained focus and raised public awareness, and ultimately, the judicial activism that brought this case to the Supreme Court.,Now, it’s time for the bad news. It won’t make a difference to the thousands of Tayyabas that labour across Pakistan in plain sight. Some of them have scars less visible than others. They can be found in our homes, in the workshops we frequent, and the factories whose products we consume.,It’s a fundamental economic law that where there is a demand, there will always be a supply network or chain. Regardless of how the Tayyaba case ends, this supply chain will continue to feed the demand.,Here is how it operates: agents, sometimes from the same village or area as the targeted child, usually approach the parents with an offer to find work for their child in one of Pakistan’s major cities. ,Many of the children come from the poverty-stricken Seraiki belt of southern Punjab, where parents with large families find it impossible to make ends meet and welcome the chance to earn a little extra money. ,Sometimes a lump sum payment is made to the parents, or a deal for monthly or even quarterly payments is reached. Usually, the middleman pockets a healthy finder’s fee and the child is left to fend for herself or himself.,This scenario is how it happened with Tayyaba too. ,According to the , from Mohammad Azam, the man who claims to be Tayyaba’s father (several sets of parents have come forth claiming she is their child), he was approached by a woman named Nadra from his neighborhood who promised to find Tayyaba employment in Faisalabad. ,Her salary was fixed at Rs 3,000 per month and Azam claimed that he was given an advance of Rs 18,000. He also claimed Tayyaba was taken to Islamabad without his knowledge and they spoke only twice on the phone in the intervening months.,A similar chain of events led to 12-year-old , being employed at the house of Chaudhry Naeem, the former president of the Lahore Bar Association.  ,Like Tayyaba, she was also brutally abused. But it was too late by the time her case reached the media’s attention. She died as a result of the injuries and sheer neglect. ,As with the case of Tayyaba, many attempts were made to subvert the course of the law, albeit successfully in this case. ,Shazia’s death was ruled to be due to ‘natural causes’, despite the fact that the preliminary medical report recorded 17 injuries to her forehead, cheek, and scalp.,This is also perhaps the sort of outcome those accused in the Tayyaba case would like to see. ,According to Mohammad Azam’s ,, the lawyer of Raja Khurram, the judge who was nominated in Tayyaba's torture case, provided the car that brought Azam from Jaranwala to Islamabad and gave him a house to stay at in Burma Town. ,Then he was told to affix his thumbprint on a legal document that he (being illiterate) was unable to read, after which the child would be returned to him. This was the so-called , which was used in an attempt to get the accused off the hook. ,Azam was taken back to the house where he claims a ‘uniformed person’ took the SIM card from his mobile phone.,If the Chief Justice of Pakistan hadn’t taken a suo motu notice, this case would have ended like Shazia Masih’s, or like countless other tragic cases that go unnoticed. ,The powerlessness of the poor is such that they cannot afford the pursuit of justice or navigate the labyrinth of the legal system due to being unable to withstand the pressure of authorities. ,In some cases, the parents are not blameless victims of society either. ,In 2013, a man named Allah Ditta contacted the Roshni helpline in Karachi saying his 12-year-old son Amir had gone missing while working in a factory. ,Thanks to the media coverage and the efforts of Roshni workers, the child was located. They found out he had fled the factory after being subjected to physical and sexual abuse. ,Roshni helped reunite the father and son, and escorted them back to their native Sadiqabad. The father returned the subsequent year to complain that his son had run away again from the same factory. ,That’s right: after returning to his hometown, Allah Ditta promptly sent his son back to the same factory where he had been beaten and assaulted.,One hopes that Tayyaba will find justice, and perhaps she will. ,Maybe the guilty will be punished and this will set a precedent or act as a deterrent for other such abusers. ,The more likely scenario is that the spotlight will move on and her family will rent her out again. ,The countless other Tayabbas will continue to remain invisible in plain sight.

","KARACHI: A young man, said to be a worker of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, was killed and many others were wounded when a demonstration in protest against the rape and murder of a seven-year-old girl turned violent and demonstrators clashed with police, who in turn resorted to baton-charge and firing in an Orangi Town area on Tuesday, officials and witnesses said.,While the PTI claimed that the deceased protester was their activist, police blamed the political party for staging a violent protest for “political mileage” neglecting the victim family’s appeal that they did not want any agitation. ,However, the police’s claim attributed to the victim’s family appears to be far from reality as Mukhtar Bibi, mother of victim Rabia, came up with a strong reaction against the police and blamed them for doing nothing since the family lodged the complaint of her disappearance on Sunday evening., ,“My child’s hands and feet were broken,” the mother told reporters at her home in Orangi’s Baloch Goth. “We are poor people. We just want justice. The police failed to perform their job.”,She went on to say: “My daughter went missing on Sunday afternoon and we approached the police station the same evening. They were so cruel that when they found the body, they declared it unidentified without bothering to inform us. We went to the Edhi morgue on our own and found her there.”,The Manghopir police found the body of the girl from bushes near the Northern Bypass area on Monday evening. An initial autopsy confirmed that the girl had been subjected to sexual assault. The body was then moved to the Edhi morgue for want of identification.,PTI claims the deceased protester was their worker; IGP orders ‘transparent’ probe ,The family of the girl finally got the news in the early hours of Tuesday and by sunrise the area turned tense as anger ran high among the people of the low-income neighbourhood.,Charged people staged a protest demonstration at the time of her funeral and blocked roads leading to Kati Pahari from Qasba Colony.,They were chanting slogans against the police and administration and turned violent when a heavy contingent of police tried to clear the road. The protesters pelted policemen and moving vehicles with stones forcing the law enforcers to retaliate. The police baton-charged the protesters and fired into the air.,Around 12 people, including four policemen, suffered injuries in stone pelting. ,Three of the protesters — 22-year-old Abdul Rehman, 48-year-old Ilyas Haider and 21-year-old Adnan Zaman — suffered gunshot wounds.,Rehman died later while the condition of Haider and Zaman was said to be out of danger., ,The police showed unawareness about the firing incident and denied their involvement in the killing of the protester. Instead, they blamed workers of PTI for “instigating violence”.,“The political elements instigated the people [to] violence for political mileage and point-scoring when the family was taking the victim girl for burial in an ambulance,” said DIG West Amir Farooqi. “When the violence erupted, the girl’s grandfather asked the area SHO for help and dissociated himself from the protest.”,About the probe into the rape and murder of the minor girl, the DIG said that the police had already arrested a couple of suspects and took their DNA samples. ,He said apparently the girl was kidnapped, raped and killed somewhere else and the body was dumped near the Northern Bypass.,Taking notice of the rape and murder as well as the violence, Sindh Inspector General of Police A.D. Khowaja ordered an inquiry into the two incidents and appointed DIG Asim Kaimkhani to lead the probe and come up with “transparent and unbiased findings”., ,The PTI came up with a strong reaction against the police and vowed to lodge a murder case against the police officers concerned. ,PTI leader Imran Ismail said the police and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) were “turning Karachi into another Gaza” and the party would not let them do that.,“The police opened fire on protesters,” he said. “It’s the people’s right to protest. Instead of taking action against the culprits, the police opened fire on those demanding justice. The blood of our worker is on the hands of the police. The party will register a case against the killing of Abdul Rehman, who was killed by the police.”,Also, the PTI was not impressed with the IGP’s directive as one of its provincial lawmakers termed it an attempt to cover up the failure of the police. ,“We are sick and tired of such inquiries,” MPA Khurram Sher Zaman said. “You people have ruined each and every department of this province. There is not much difference between Sindh and Punjab police.”,He said it was a peaceful protest and area people were protesting along with the parents of the girl. The parents had filed a report at the area police station when their daughter went missing but “unfortunately just like the Zainab case, police here failed to arrest the culprits”.,  ,PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari strongly condemned the rape and murder of the seven-year-old girl in the Manghopir area and asked the Sindh government to take stern action against the culprits involved in this barbaric act. ,In a statement, the PPP chairman said that her tormentors and killers would not be allowed to flee from the law and urged that they must be severely punished as per law. ,He also expressed sympathies with the parents of the victim and assured them that PPP government would take every step to provide justice to them.

1317,2018-04-18,"India tired of rape culture excuses
","THE brutal rape and cold-blooded murder of an eight-year-old Muslim shepherd girl, allegedly to drive her nomadic tribe out an area of India-held Kashmir, and the rape of an 18-year-old girl, allegedly by a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator, has Indians sick of the rising crimes against women.,Many remember the rallies five years ago after the brutal gang rape of a young woman, known as Nirbhaya (the brave one), on a moving bus in New Delhi in December 2012. The case drew international attention and sparked calls for a national introspection.,The government at the time promised tougher anti-rape measures and to clean up the system which sometimes fault victims and shields the accused.,Tougher anti-rape laws were put into place, awarding life term or death to rapists. However, statistics show that there has been no decline in the number of sexual assaults in India. The tedious legal process and a low conviction rate, mostly due to poor forensics and investigation, have diminished people’s faith in the judicial system.,According to India’s National Crime Records Bureau that collects annual data on crimes, in 2016, India recorded 106 rapes a day. A large number of those raped were girls in the age group of 0 to 12 years. In 94.6 per cent of cases, the offenders were known to the victims.,Of the 338,954 crimes against women registered in 2016, 38,947 were rapes and 2,167 gang rapes. Of the 260,304 cases of crimes against women sent for trial in courts in 2016, conviction was secured in only 23,094 cases.,The numbers unfortunately reflect only the registered cases in patriarchal and misogynist India where rape is seen as a woman’s shame.,A majority of crimes against women remain unregistered — as is seen in the Unnao rape victim’s travails, or because of the stigma attached to reporting rapes and sexual crimes. More often than not women are blamed for the rape — accused of dressing inappropriately and inviting the male gaze.,How ingrained this malaise is in Indian society can be gauged by the fact that politicians have gone on record dismissing rapes as boyish mistakes or suggesting the raped women be hanged.,The Association for Democratic Reforms, a non-profit watchdog for electoral reforms, in a 2017 report revealed that of the 4,852 election affidavits it studied, it found that three lawmakers and 48 legislators faced cases of crimes against women.,Not a day goes by when rape cases do not make headlines. Even as Indians are trying to deal with the chilling details of the Kathua rape case, another report of an 11-year-old’s rape and murder — she was found dead in Gujarat with 86 injuries — is making headlines.,However, knee-jerk reactions will not help. India needs better policing and sensitive yet strategic handling of such cases. ,The authorities need to ensure that victims from lower castes or poor backgrounds are heard and not denied justice, and victims need quick medical examinations without embarrassing them with unnecessary questioning. ,Authorities also need better techniques for fool-proof forensics, and there should be protection for witnesses, special cells to hear such cases in a humane manner, fast track courts for speedy justice, and finally, and most importantly, women need to be encouraged to speak up against sexual crimes and not see this as their shame.,Lamat R Hasan is an associate editor at Asia News Network."

DIG Farooqi said that the accused’s DNA samples will soon be sent for examination.,Sindh Home Minister Sohail Anwar Sial visited Orangi Town today and met the relatives of the slain girl.,The home minister accused the PTI leadership of ""playing politics with the girl's coffin"".,Sial said two of the three suspects are already in police custody and so there was no ""justification"" for the protest.,He promised that action would also be taken against policemen if any of them are found guilty of heavy-handedness.,Haleem Adil Shaikh, a local PTI leader, said that Tuesday’s violence was the outcome of ""mishandling"" on police's part, clarifying that no PTI worker was involved in sparking riots or inciting violence.,Shaikh claimed that the protesters did not resort to firing and were unarmed — a fact he said the media personnel present at the time would corroborate.,""If the police officers had come out of their offices on time, such loss of human life could have been avoided,"" he said, alleging that the police resorted to firing after the area's SHO was hurt.,The PTI leader demanded for an FIR to be registered against the police over the protester's death, warning that the failure to do so would force them to hold another protest on Thursday."

Nine children were abused daily, it says. ,The report has been made from monitoring 91 newspapers, local, regional and national, and the cases that have been reported. ,Experts suggest that these cases may just be the tip of the iceberg as many areas are remote or people do not report cases for various reasons, including treating the subject as taboo and family relations with perpetrator. ,The statistics were launched at the Lahore Press Club on Wednesday by the NGO that has been releasing the ‘Cruel Numbers’ report for the past 17 years in collated form. ,According to the reported cases, 1,039 incidents of abduction took place, 467 cases were reported under rape, 366 under sodomy, 158 under gang rape, 180 under gang sodomy and 206 cases of attempted child sexual abuse were highlighted. ,The report says 29 boys and 36 girls were murdered after being made victims of sexual abuse. Eight boys and as many girls were murdered after gang sodomy and rape. ,As many as 517 children were found missing from their homes. Related to this were 143 cases of early child marriage and 24 of vani, says the report. ,As specified in earlier news reports, most of the perpetrators knew the family or the children well and are the highest in the list. Out of the total number of cases (3,445) there are 1,421 cases where the abusers are acquainted with the child or his/her family. Strangers abusing the children were involved in 508 reported cases. ,The report also reveals that most of the victims fell in the age range of 11 to 15 years. Around 961 such cases were reported.

Punjab has the highest population count. ,In Lahore, there were 112 incidents reported in 2017; 29 children were abducted and 39 reported missing. Thirteen cases of rape, seven cases of sodomy, one case of gang rape, and four cases of gang sodomy were recorded in the city. ,Sahil gave its recommendations for prevention of child sexual abuse and exploitation.

","Jurors at the , against Bill Cosby are poised to start deliberating after a marathon day of closing arguments that portrayed the comedian both as a calculating predator who’s finally being brought to justice as well as the victim of a multimillion-dollar frame-up by a “pathological liar”.,The seven men and five women sequestered at a suburban Philadelphia hotel will start weighing charges on Wednesday in the first big celebrity trial of the #MeToo era. They begged off a late Tuesday start, saying they were exhausted from 5½ hours of arguments.,The prosecution and defense gave them lots to think about after a two-week trial pitting Cosby, the 80-year-old comedian once revered as “America’s Dad”, against Andrea Constand, a former Temple University sports administrator who testified that he knocked her out with three pills he called “your friends” and molested her at his suburban Philadelphia mansion in January 2004.,“The time for the defendant to escape justice is over. It’s finally time for the defendant to dine on the banquet of his own consequences,” prosecutor Stewart Ryan said, imploring jurors to stand with Constand, look Cosby in the eye and “tell him the truth about what he did”.,Cosby’s lawyers argued that the charges were based on “flimsy, silly, ridiculous evidence”.,This time, prosecutors had five other women testify that Cosby drugged and violated them. One accuser asked him through tears, “You remember, don’t you, Mr Cosby?” Cosby’s lawyers, who contend the encounter was consensual, called a woman who said Constand spoke of framing a high-profile person to sue and extract a big settlement.,None of that was allowed at Cosby’s streamlined first trial, which ended in a hung jury last year after deliberations over six days. Nor were jurors told the amount of Cosby’s 2006 civil settlement with Constand: nearly $3.4 million, which defense lawyer Tom Mesereau on Tuesday called “one of the biggest highway robberies of all time”.,“I have never seen or heard of a retrial that was as different as this was from the first trial,” said lawyer Dennis McAndrews, who’s been in court following the retrial and is not associated with either side. “The prosecution now had multiple victims and the defense had the issue of money, which were powerful weapons for both sides.”,Cosby faces three counts of aggravated indecent assault, each carrying up to 10 years in prison. His wife of 54 years, Camille, looked on from the gallery as his lawyers pleaded with the jury to clear him, the first time she has attended the trial. She also sat in for the defense’s closing argument at his first trial.,Camille Cosby, 74, had stayed away as the prosecution built its case that her husband maintained a sordid double life, plying women with drugs and preying on them sexually. Before the jury came in, she put her arm around Cosby, who is legally blind. They smiled and chatted, and he gave her a peck on the cheek. When it was the prosecution’s turn to argue, she left the courtroom, and Constand entered.,“You’re dealing with a pathological liar, members of the jury,” said Mesereau, who won an acquittal in ,. “You are.”,Prosecutor Kristen Feden called Cosby the true con artist — wresting that label from Cosby’s lawyers, who had applied it to Constand throughout the trial.,“Yes, you did hear about a con,” Feden said, her voice rising as she moved toward Cosby and pointed at him. “The perpetrator of that con is this man, sitting right here.”,She warned that the man trusted for his role as genial, sweater-wearing Dr. Cliff Huxtable on , is “nothing like the image that he played on TV”.,The defense highlighted more than a dozen inconsistencies in what Constand has said over the years and painstakingly reviewed phone and travel records, saying they prove the alleged assault couldn’t have happened when she says it did. They argued that he was charged after the 12-year statute of limitations for prosecuting him had run out.,The victim of sexual assault has been identified with Constand's permission."

However, there is a larger lesson to be learned from the tragedy. ,There are many young people in the West who, like Sana Cheema, are second-, third- or even fourth-generation immigrants of Pakistani descent. Even if the older generations have found integration difficult in their homes in the West, it is unjust and illogical of them to expect their descendants — particularly women — to follow the patriarchal mores of their country of origin. ,In Pakistan, such killings are a gruesome reminder of how, for long, the law was lax when it came to punishing those who committed this horrendous crime — indeed, instead of being looked upon as murder, the practice is still seen by many as an exercise in protecting family ‘honour’. ,Investigations have yet to confirm the cause of Sana Cheema’s death. If it is proved that she was a victim of ‘honour’ killing, she will join the unfortunate ranks of the thousands of women in this country to have met this fate. "

1365,2018-04-27,"Footprints: A poor man's daughter
","ALL Baka Muhammad remembers from the Sunday before last is the heat. ,“It was so hot that afternoon. My head was pounding and all I wanted was to be left alone. My daughter… my Rabia…kept asking me to play with her, but I had to sit at my uncle’s showroom and work. So I told her to go home or to her uncle’s and play with his children,” he said. ,“I didn’t know that was the last thing I would say to her.” ,On April 15, a few hours after six-year-old Rabia went off to play with her cousins, she was kidnapped, gang-raped and murdered. ,In the evening when Baka got home, he lay down on a charpoy and asked his wife about the children. She replied that out of their brood of six, five were home. The second to youngest, a five-year-old girl who had been playing with Rabia, had returned a few minutes ago. ,“Where is Rabia?” he asked. ,“I don’t know. She hasn’t come back yet,” the mother replied. ,They waited and waited for her to come home. But there was no sign of her anywhere. ,“I went to the neighbourhood mosque and asked them to make an announcement for her to come home,” he said, adding that since there was no response, he took a loudspeaker and attached it to his friend’s rickshaw and went all over MPR Colony’s Baloch quarters to look for her. ,With no sign of his child, Baka decided to go to the police and file a report. ,The next day, Baka said, he went looking for her again, but no luck. ,Baka, who hails from Jacobabad, moved to Kati Pahari, once a no-go area, after the 2010 floods. “I used to drive a donkey cart in the village and deliver water to people. After the floods, there was nothing left there. One by one my family also moved to the city for better work opportunities,” he said, cradling his youngest child in his lap, swatting away flies buzzing above their heads. ,Later that day, Baka recalled, his brother called him and asked him what colour were Rabia’s clothes the day she went missing. ,“I told him she was wearing a yellow kameez, red shalwar and red chapals,” he said, adding that minutes later his brother said his daughter had been injured and he should hurry to the Manghopir police station. ,“He didn’t tell me she was dead. My brother didn’t want me to do something stupid in rage or despair. I found out the truth when I got to the police station,” said the father. ,At the police station, Baka said, he learnt that his daughter had been tortured, raped and killed. Her limp body had cigarette burns all over. ,Baka’s wife wails as he recounts his daughter’s story sitting in their two-room house. “She’s been like this since we found the body. She cries and cries and passes out because of exhaustion.” ,After the post-mortem, Baka said, he went to the Orangi police station, where the initial missing report had been filed, and named a few suspects in an FIR. Four of these men have been arrested. ,According to Baka, the main suspect became a part of his extended family when he married a cousin. “He used to hang around the showroom I sit at and give candy to my daughter. I noticed it a few times, but thought it was harmless,” Baka explained. ,“I never thought he’d do something like this. When I met him in the lock-up, I asked him to tell me the names of the others. I know he didn’t do this alone. He told me that I had slighted him once and this was his revenge,” said Baka. ,The suspect’s son was arrested at the crime scene and while evidence was collected, the room where the incident took place — just 1.5kilometres from where Rabia used to live — had not been sealed. ,“Once we had the body in our hands, I wanted to give her a proper burial, but some of my neighbours told me to take the body to Jamshed Pump, a petrol station near Kati Pahari,” Baka said. ,He claimed that while he felt quite uncertain, a man named Amanullah encouraged him to protest. ,“We took the body and kept it on ice. Amanullah is a good man. He was trying to help, but then some goons came and tried to take over. They ruined everything,” he said, adding that due to riots caused by the protest, Amanullah and his men ended up behind bars with terrorism charges against them. ,“I am a day labourer. I am a poor man. I can’t do much alone. The government should take notice of this and make sure that the main suspect and his accomplices are hanged. I just want justice,” he said. ,Rocking his youngest child in a makeshift dupatta hammock hanging from the charpoy, Baka said he had heard of other children getting abducted in his neighbourhood and thought he had been lucky, but fate had other plans.

1385,2018-05-02,"CM takes notice of tweet against MPA
","LAHORE: Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif has taken notice of a tweet of a young woman of a Christian family against a PML-N woman MPA, accusing the lawmaker of using the police to harass her family, according to the sources who say the CM has sought a detailed report from the police high-ups on the matter. ,Ruth Stephen, addressing the PML-N, in her tweet had said: “A land mafia, backed by a selected MP of yours is bent upon grabbing our church land in @CMShehbaz constituency. They’ve been framing false cases against us, making a judicial suit as a criminal one”. ,The sources in police said that the CM had sought a report on the case. ,Ms Ruth’s family is in civil litigation to get possession of five kanal disputed land. She alleged that MPA Mary Gill has been backing her father, Raja Nathaniel Gill, to implicate her (Ruth’s) family in many criminal cases to grab the disputed land in Youhanabad which was obtained for a church. ,“Nathaniel Gill, a senior lawyer by profession, misused his authority, bribed Nishtar Colony police and lodged four criminal cases against my family members,” Abraham Stephen, Ruth’s brother, told Dawn on Tuesday. ,He said three FIRs were registered in 2017 and another some three weeks back with the Nishtar Colony Police Station. He lamented the police nominated his elderly father, Stephen Illyas, and 19-year-old brother Joshua Stephen, an A level student, in these cases. ,“I am an engineer by profession and Mr Nathanial Gill also lodged a criminal case against me with the same police station,” Mr Abraham said, adding that his rival had filed over 20 applications against them with the police. ,The first three FIRs were registered against him and his other family members under the Telegraph Act and the last one for setting Nathaniel’s car on fire, Abraham gave details. He alleged that all the applications were filed on the letter head of MPA Marry Gill and purpose was to harass him and his family to force them to withdraw the case from the civil court. ,He complained that his family had suffered a lot due to police’s rude behaviour during the last couple of years, adding that his father had severe heart and paralysis attacks due to the harassment. ,Abraham, however, said he and his family got a little bit relief after the chief minister took notice of his sister’s tweet on Monday. ,Divisional SP Faisal Shahzad called the both the parties and after giving sympathetic hearing barred the local police from lodging further any case against his family. ,MPA Mary Gill strongly denied the allegation leveled against her, saying: “The Stephen family had tactfully dragged me in the case being political leader. ,“I am an MPA from the ruling party and it is very easy to target me. It is matter of fact that Nathanial Gill is my father but I have nothing to do with the case of disputed land in question,” she went on saying. ,Ms Gill said neither her letterhead was used to lodge cases against Mr Stephen and his family nor would she allow anyone to misuse it. ,She suggested to the Stephen family to avoid politicising the ‘local dispute’. ,Mr Nathanial Gill’s stance complicated the matter when he claimed that the disputed land was not meant for the church. ,“The Stephen family members are deliberately twisting the facts by giving the matter a religious colour to gain sympathies of the authorities as they fear that the judgment of the court is coming against them,” he said. ,Highlighting background perspective of the disputed land, Mr Nathaniel claimed the disputed piece of land was actually owned by some Muslim people of the same area. ,“It is matter of fact that it doesn’t belong to any of Christians or reserved for Church,” he said and added that originally the disputed land measuring total 66 marla was owned by one Muhammad Abdul Rehman. ,Out of which, Mr Rehman sold out 19 marla to a local Muslim man, Salim Amir, settled in America, 10 marla each to Nargis Siddique and May Simen and one kanal and seven marla to an elderly lady, Kalli Bibi. ,“Later I purchased three kanal and six marla piece of land from Kalli Bibi in 1995,” Mr Nathanial added. ,As the land was located adjacent to the house of Mr Stephen, he illegally encroached on it a couple of years back at night, raising walls, putting up a gate and displaying on it the symbol of crucifixion, Nathanial alleged. ,His rival also displayed a board ‘Convention Centre and Assembly of God’ giving it a religious colour, issuing a threat to the Muslim owners that he would bring the matter to the authorities for ‘an attempt to grab Church property’. ,“I went into the litigation and after fighting the case for two years, got possession of the land through the bailiff,” Mr Nathanial said. ,He denied the allegation of using influence of the police to implicate his rival family in any cases. ,Model Town Division SP (Operations) Faisal Shahzad rejected the allegation leveled by the Stephen family against the police saying the accused had been declared guilty of charges in three out of the four cases lodged against them. ,He said in the last case of setting car on fire, the two local residents had submitted an affidavit that they had witnessed Stephen family members while committing the crime. ,“I called both the families on Monday, heard their respective claims and took a decision to resolve the issue,” Mr Shahzad said. ,He said both the parties had agreed to refer the matter to ‘alternate dispute resolution’ for a permanent solution. ,An important meeting to this effect has been called within a couple of days to reach a resolution, the SP said."

","UMERKOT: Amisha Khaskheli — said to be under 18 and alleged to have been tricked into a marriage scam along with her parents by some influential community men and the city’s women police personnel — was produced before Umerkot civil judge Amir Rajput on Thursday to record her statement under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).,She stated that she was abducted by Faizullah Palli and Saifullah Palli with the help of SHO Khush Bakht of the local women police station. The judge handed over the girl to her parents.,Before making her statement, she came across some local reporters when she was brought back to Umerkot by a team of the Pinyari police station. The reporters quoted her as saying that she was drugged by the SHO at the police station and that when she regained her senses she found herself at the house of the Pallis. ,Amisha was taken into custody along with five other persons by the SHO and her team on April 17 in a raid on a ceremony in Hashim Palli village where an alleged underage marriage was under way. The SHO took the plea that Amisha was only 13. ,The underage groom, Shahzeb, was also there but he was not taken into custody, it was learnt. ,In order to hush up the matter, the groom’s side got an affidavit executed to state under oath that the ceremony was for an engagement and not wedding and that the wedding would not be solemnised until Amisha attained the legal age for marriage.,Eventually, the girl and suspects were set free and an impression was created that Amisha was going to be handed over to her parents. However, her mother, Umran Khaskheli, moved the Sindh High Court on April 30 with the plea that the groom’s side had taken away her daughter and the SHO was not helping recover her from them. The court ordered the girl’s recovery and fixed the matter for May 7. ,Faizullah and Saifullah, sensing gravity of the situation, had surrendered themselves before the Umerkot police on April 26 and stated that they had no knowledge about the girl’s whereabouts. ,On Wednesday (May 2), a retired police head constable, Muharram Baloch, appeared at the Pinyari police station along with Amisha and claimed that he had ‘found’ her near Tando Allahyar road. ,The questions that to whom the girl was handed over by the SHO and how she reached a place far away from her house in Umerkot remained a mystery. ,Ghulam Nabi Shah, a cousin of the two suspects, on Thursday revealed that an [unspecified] amount of money was involved in the whole episode. He claimed that the girl’s parents had taken a loan from the Pallis and hinted that the matter of the girl’s engagement/marriage was linked with the same loan. He named some “characters” supposedly involved in the episode. He claimed that Amisha’s parents, who served as peasants of the Pallis, were not in a position to repay the loan and, therefore, had agreed to the [compensatory] marriage proposal. ,Ghulam Nabi Shah alleged that the “characters” instigated the bride’s side to demand Rs5 million from his cousins after the matter was highlighted and police were involved. He claimed that his cousins, at one stage, even agreed to settle the matter for Rs2m. ,Taking notice of the matter, Sindh Inspector General of Police (IGP) A.D. Khowaja on Thursday ordered that Amisha be given in custody of the Hyderabad police and a thorough investigation into the episode be conducted.,The IGP constituted a three-member committee comprising Mirpurkhas SSP Nazeer Ahmed Mallah, Umerkot SSP Aijaz Ahmed Shaikh and Umerkot DSP Fazlul Haq Chandio to hold the probe."

","LAHORE: The government-run Violence against Women Centre (VAWC) Multan has recorded 1,545 cases of violence against women (VAW) from March 2017 to April 2018. ,According to the data provided by the Social Welfare Department, the highest number of registered cases is of domestic abuse (918 cases), followed by 165 family cases, 99 harassment cases and 89 property disputes. ,Salman Sufi, heading the CM’s Strategic Reforms Unit (SRU) – the authority in charge of the project – says the centre has started functioning completely and that the locals have now begun taking it seriously. ,The VAWC was set up following the Punjab Protection of Women against Violence Act 2016, the law that was heavily countered by hard liners. The figures point out that the pandemic of gender-based violence is highest in Punjab with most reported cases. ,The first VAWC was established in south Punjab because of the high number of gender-based crimes there. It is meant to be a 24/7 facility run completely by women to streamline investigation-prosecution case flow process by bringing all disconnected justice delivery services under one roof. The services provided at the VAWC include those by police, prosecution, medical, rehabilitation and counseling. There is also a shelter for women survivors of violence who have no home to go to. ,The Punjab Women Protection Authority Act (PWPA) was passed in 2017 to ensure that centres like the VAWC are established across Punjab; however, their headquarters will remain in Multan. ,“The government has really given its all for setting up such a centre to prove that it gives a safe and easy access to women who want to report crimes against them,” says Sufi. “We hope the success of this place will push the other provinces too.” ,The Punjab Women Protection Authority (PWPA) moved a request for appointment of judges to exclusively deal with the cases registered with the VAWC. ,Pursuant to orders by the Lahore High Court (LHC), two judges have now been notified by the District and Sessions Judge, Multan. Justice Tasmia Akhtar will be the Trial Court judge and Justice Saeed Ahmed Mukhtar Khan will serve as the Appellate Court exclusively for the cases registered at VAWC. ,Meanwhile, Aurat Foundation’s regional director Mumtaz Mughal lauded the centre for being a useful initiative. However, she expressed reservations about the way the VAW was being dealt with by the government. ,“The intentions are in the right place, but the problem lies in a follow-up system,” she says. “There should be a system where monitoring is done of women who go back outside and live their lives. Are they potential victims of violence? Or are they safe now? And this cannot be ascertained until the local government system in that area is strengthened.” ,Ms Mumtaz explains the local government could serve as a way of raising awareness and having a complaint and monitoring mechanism, especially with lady councilors. ,“Women face a lot of difficulties in reporting crimes and they need this kind of place where everything is under one roof – especially a sensitised staff,” she says. ,The problem of lack of follow up is also voiced by Shazia Sarwar, AIG of Punjab Gender Crimes wing. “As someone who works on women-related cases, I know that women need such places badly, especially women who come from rural areas who do not have safe access to a police station,” she says. ,“Women face the most violence from home, first from their husbands and then from their brothers, especially if the case is related to property.” Sarwar adds that only a few cases under Section 509 have been reported because women do not feel safe going to a local police station. ,“While the bigger cases are monitored, it is the smaller cases – like harassment – that may be a cause for concern where lack of monitoring is concerned.” ,Meanwhile, DSP Shahida Nasreen says the 1,545 cases filed were those directly filed with the VAWC. There may have been even more cases (300 more approximately) which the other offices such as the CPO or IG referred to the VAWC. “In a year, 1,800 cases have been accepted by the centre,” she claims. ,Will this kind of system have any solid effects in the long term? ,Deputy Superintendent of Police Nasreen says it will, because when people see the police coming to nab a suspect or an accused, the others would think twice before committing any such crime."

For her assassination, the then government of Gen Pervez Musharraf had blamed TTP chief Baituallah Mehsud, who later denied any involvement in her killing.,When the Punjab prison authorities were contacted, the officials said they had not received the court orders for the release on bail of the five TTP suspects from the Kot Lakhpat jail. ,However, an official of the prison department said the release orders were likely to be received on Tuesday or Wednesday. He added that the provincial government could extend their detention as the Punjab government had the legal authority to do so.,On Monday, the two-member LHC bench accepted the plea of the father of Aitzaz Shah, one of the five suspects, who said he had nothing left to pay fee to his lawyers. The court ordered their release on submission of surety bonds worth Rs 500,000 by each suspect. ,The bench further directed the authorities concerned to ensure their presence at every hearing of the case.,Earlier, an Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Rawalpindi in its Aug 31, 2017 verdict acquitted the five TTP suspects and handed down 17-year jail terms to two police officers for criminal negligence in ordering the hosing down of the crime-scene and their failure to provide security to Ms Bhutto. The ATC also declared retired Gen Pervez Musharraf an absconder in the case. ,Soon after their acquittal by the ATC, the five TTP suspects were detained for 30 days at the Adiala central jail on the recommendation of the Counter-Terrorism Department of the Punjab police. On Sept 1, 2017, a CTD district officer informed the Rawalpindi district administration through a letter that the release from jail of Sher Zaman, resident of North Wazirstan, would be prejudicial to public safety and maintenance of public order. The district administration subsequently issued detention orders under Section 26 of the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) ordinance for the five suspects for a period of one month. After the completion of the month-long detention, they were detained for another 60 days. On Nov 28, 2017, the TTP suspects were again detained for three more months on a directive of the LHC. "

1425,2018-05-09,"No let-up in ‘honour’ crime
","			,IT may be hot — swelteringly and terrifyingly hot — in most of the country, but the brisk business of killing women (and some men) in the name of honour continues apace. Some weeks ago, an angry man, mad at his sisters over some domestic dispute, began beating them with a stick. When his 100-year-old grandmother tried to intervene, he began to beat her too. Age is not a factor when it comes to male privilege; when he was done, the century-old grandmother as well as one of his sisters was dead. The other sister lay in critical condition in the hospital. ,Take this month. On the very first day of May, a man shot his sister and her alleged paramour to death in Charsadda. In another incident, a young couple in Karachi set out to have dinner with the wife’s family. The two had married of their own will almost two years ago and her family had been upset about the relationship. When the two were returning from the dinner, unknown assailants stopped the rickshaw they were in (the husband was a rickshaw driver) and pumped their bodies with bullets. Both of them died.,In news reports, the police were waiting to contact someone in the husband’s family for filing the FIR because the wife’s family was believed to have been involved in the killing.,These are just the latest stories in Pakistan’s ongoing saga of women and some men being killed in the name of honour. Over the 70-something years for which Pakistan has existed, the country has been busy murdering its own, mostly women and some men, for the ‘crime’ of refusing marriage, imagined relationships in which accusations serve as an excuse for male rage, made-up relationships that assist in covering up crimes to get inheritances or do away with inconvenient neighbours. ,A demand can be made for a special investigation unit to probe the motivations behind ‘honour’ killings. ,Just about every conflict lends itself to an honour killing, a cover via which the whole neighbourhood and society claps for the killer and looks the other way as investigations languish and justice is shelved.,All this was supposed to have changed, at least a little bit, when parliament passed an anti-honour killing law in 2016. By subjecting those who perpetrate ‘honour’ crimes to at least mandatory life sentences and not permitting the crime to be ‘forgiven’ by the family, it was believed that honour crimes would decrease or even end. The mechanism of collusion, in which family members commit such crimes and then are summarily ‘forgiven’ by other family members, would be done away with. ,One hoped that a blow had also been dealt to the idea that a death can be permissible or ‘honourable’. Murder is always murder, and mandatory punishments were a way of underscoring this fact that seemed to be contested in Pakistan. ,This hopeful experiment has failed. According to statistics maintained by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, 1,280 people have been murdered in honour crimes since the enactment of the law. Of these, for more than half no FIRs had been registered or there was no information. Obviously, cases in which no FIR is registered do not result in criminal prosecutions. In addition, according to the experts, these numbers, which are based on estimates from the news media and similar sources, are likely underreported. If the actually reported number of ‘honour’ killings is continuing at a furious rate, then the real number may have increased even more. ,These cases do not even come within the purview of the new legislation, the purpose of which was to impose mandatory sentences in instances of ‘honour’ crimes. For this to happen, the case has to be classified as an ‘honour’ crime when it is being filed. If it is not classified as such, how can the sentence be applicable? The easy way out, then, is to simply insist that there was some other motivation for the crime.,The result is before us; ‘honour’ crimes (even those actually being classified as such) are continuing to take place. They are, in fact, likely increasing even if many FIRs make no mention of ‘honour’ as a motivation for the crime.,If the fight against honour crimes is real, and Pakistanis have not become so callous as to be completely immune to these reports — to the electrocuting of teenage couples, to the bullet-riddled bodies of dinner guests coming home, to the burned and charred and strangled bodies of women — then a demand must be made for a special investigation unit that looks into the motivations of these killings. ,The onus of ensuring that honour killings are actually classified as such and do not evade the mandatory punishment must be on law enforcement. If this is deemed unfeasible for reasons of cost, the time may have come when ‘forgiveness’ for murders is finally done away with. This would mean that all murders would be subject to mandatory sentences, a fact that would reduce not only ‘honour’ crimes but also the overall murder rate in the country as a whole.,Statutory legal systems such as the one in operation in Pakistan do not function well when there is a hodgepodge of rationales, the possibility of punishments that do not involve imprisonment, such as the payment of money or forgiveness, that render the current system handicapped. The only way to end this kind of crime, which kills scores in brutal ways within the country and allots Pakistan a reputation for misogyny and barbarity the world over, is to make sure that these steps are carried out, that laws that do not work are replaced with ones that do.

evidence, it emerged on Friday.,The armed clashes between activists of political parties that broke out on the streets during deposed Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry’s visit to the city, had left over 50 people dead and 100 injured.,The country’s then top judge had arrived in the city on the invitation of the Sindh High Court Bar Association to address a huge gathering of lawyers on the premises of the SHC building, but had to remain confined to the airport before flying back to Islamabad as violence spread across Karachi.,While various cases were registered by the lawyers and the political activists at different police stations, trials for only seven cases could begin and that too moved at a snail’s pace.,Currently, four cases are pending trial before the antiterrorism court-II and three before the antiterrorism court-III since long as police investigators could not make any major breakthrough in the investigation.,However, the cases took a dramatic turn after nine years when the Rangers arrested Kamran Farooq, a member of the Sindh Assembly belonging to the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, who was absconding in several cases pertaining to May 12, on Dec 16, 2016.,Farooq, who was booked in two cases for allegedly carrying grenades and unlicensed weapons, had recorded his confessional statement before a judicial magistrate under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), making startling revelations about the alleged involvement of the MQM leadership in one of the most violent episodes of the country’s history.,All the cases are still pending at the pre-trial stage,In his confessional statement, recorded on Dec 20, the then interned MQM MPA had not only confessed to his involvement in the May 12, 2007 mayhem but also implicated party leader Dr Farooq Sattar.,According to his statement, a copy of which is available with Dawn, suspect Farooq stated that he joined the MQM in 2000 and worked as the party’s “unit and sector in-charge”.,He added that he was given a party ticket to contest the 2013 general election on the recommendation of the then chief of the Karachi Tanzeemi Committee, Hammad Siddiqui.,About his involvement in the May 12 events, he told the magistrate that a meeting was held on May 10, 2007 at the party’s Nine Zero headquarters in the presence of Dr Farooq Sattar, Mr Siddiqui and other leaders. ,He said that the “party leadership” had asked him and other “sector in-charges” to ensure that lawyers could not reach the Karachi airport to welcome Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry.,He testified that he along with his armed accomplices blocked many thoroughfares on May 12 and resorted to firing leaving many wounded.,While the MQM spokesperson had rejected Farooq’s confessional statement, the Rangers prosecution department insisted that it was still a crucial piece of evidence.,“Two years have passed since Kamran Farooq made his confession, which is crucial evidence legally admissible in court as the same was recorded before a judicial magistrate,” Advocate Sajid Mehboob Sheikh, head of the Rangers prosecution department, told Dawn. ,“However, the police high-ups have failed to use this evidence in all the cases relating to the May 12 incidents till today,” he claimed.,He cited the example of a similar confessional statement recorded by the defunct Peoples Amn Committee’s (PAC) chief Uzair Jan Baloch, who was interrogated in a criminal case, who had made startling disclosures about the involvement of high-profile political figures and police high-ups in various criminal activities.,“Uzair Baloch’s confessional statement is now being used in 62 criminal cases pending against him and others being tried in different antiterrorism courts,” argued the paramilitary force’s special prosecutor, who is defending the Rangers cases in the ATCs.,On the other hand, the judicial sources said all the cases were still pending at the pre-trial stage, as the police had yet to nominate those named by Kamran Farooq in his confessional statement.,Some believed that there was a lack of interest on the part of the provincial prosecution department.,When contacted by Dawn, former prosecutor general Shahadat Awan, who was responsible for getting the confessional statement of Kamran Farooq, seemed least bothered about the matter.,Awan put the responsibility of having used the confession in the cases on the Rangers, which was not performing role of prosecution in these cases.,The lawyers’ leaders interviewed by Dawn demanded that the law-enforcement agencies as well as the government should ensure that justice was dispensed to the families of the victims and survivors of the May 12 bloodshed and its perpetrators were punished.,It may be recalled that while the police had booked and arrested 15 suspects, including City Mayor Wasim Akhtar, Mohammad Aslam alias Kala, Anwarul Hasan, Faisal Wahab, Azhar Qureshi and Mohammed Hanif in four cases relating to May 12 mayhem and had submitted a final charge sheet against them before the administrative judge of antiterrorism courts in Sept 2016, it had failed to make Kamran Farooq’s confessional statement part of evidence in those cases.,Currently,

","KARACHI: An antiterrorism court on Saturday issued a notice to the special public prosecutor on an application seeking bail for former senior police superintendent Rao Anwar Ahmed in a case relating to extrajudicial killing of Naqeeb Ullah Mehsud and three others in an alleged staged encounter. ,The judge of ATC-I directed the special public prosecutor to submit reply on May 14. ,The former SSP and his 10 detained subordinates and around 15 absconding officers are accused of abducting Naseemullah, better known as Naqeeb Ullah Mehsud, for ransom and killing him with three other detainees in a staged encounter in Malir on Jan 13. ,Ex-SSP’s lawyer terms murder case a product of professional rivalry,Former SSP Rao Anwar — who is currently detained in the Multan Lines in the cantonment area, which was declared as a sub-jail due to reported threats to his life — had moved an application through his counsel Amir Mansoob Qureshi seeking bail in connection with the main case pertaining to the murder of the aspiring model with others registered at the Sachal police station. ,In the application, it was argued that an inquiry committee constituted by the IG police on Jan 25, comprising Additional IG Counter-Terrorism Department Sana Ullah Abbasi and others, had assigned the responsibility of the alleged encounter to officials of the Shah Lateef Town police station, who had admittedly participated in an encounter. ,Yet the FIR was registered only against former SSP Rao Anwar, the lawyer alleged, adding that the inquiry committee had obtained the technical analysis report of the applicant’s cellphone number, which showed his presence on the scene of the incident or within its vicinity after the alleged encounter at 15.00 to 15.20 hours. However, as per modern devices the applicant had reached the place of the incident at 15.21 or 15.22 hours, he claimed. ,The lawyer said that after former SSP voluntarily surrendered to the Supreme Court, the proceedings pending against him were dropped and a joint investigation team was formed. ,“The JIT itself is self explanatory as it is neither inculpatory nor exculpatory, as it is based on a report recorded under Section 168 of the CrPC wherein the applicant has not been marked as black, grey or white,” he contended, arguing that the JIT report was an inadmissible document and could only be used as a report under Section 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which was itself not a substantial piece of evidence and required serious consideration of the court. ,The lawyer claimed that the murder case against his client was, in fact, a ‘case of no evidence’ and a product of professional rivalry. ,He pointed out that two eyewitnesses, Muhammad Qasim Daud Khan and Hazrat Ali, had neither implicated the suspended SSP in their statements recorded before the police under Section 161 and before the judicial magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC except at belated stage, one of the prosecution witnesses in his statement recorded under Section 164 of the CrPC had alleged that on Jan 17 he had identified the applicant’s voice after listening to the press statement that took place on Jan 13. ,He added that the trial court had granted remand of the applicant for a suitable time, but the prosecution had failed to produce him for identification of voice before the competent magistrate. ,The defence counsel added that the statement of an alleged eyewitness, who was allegedly let off after being kidnapped with deceased Naqeeb Ullah Mehsud, was recorded after a delay of 17 days, which also needed further inquiry. ,He maintained that the applicant could not be kept in custody for a punishment in advance in the absence of any incriminating material. ,The lawyer maintained that the applicant was entitled for bail. ,He asked the court to grant post-arrest bail to ex-SSP Rao Anwar. ,He argued that the investigation carried out by different senior police officials revealed that neither was there the charge of abduction of the deceased accused persons on Rao Anwar, nor was any ransom demanded from their relatives for their release. ,He alleged that the applicant was charged with abduction with mala fide intentions or ulterior motives which required the court’s consideration to bring the case for further probe. ,Therefore, he pleaded to the court to grant post-arrest bail to the former SSP.

Only one of those charged today is in jail.,Akhtar, while speaking to reporters after the hearing, complained that 40 cases had been lodged against him after his nomination as a mayor, with as many as 20 first information reports filed against him in one day.,The hearing of the case will resume on June 23.,While various cases have been registered by lawyers and political activists at different police stations, trials for only seven cases have begun, and those too have moved at snail’s pace.,Currently, four cases have been pending trial before antiterrorism court-II, and three before the antiterrorism court-III, for a while as police investigators have not been able to make any major breakthrough in the investigation.,However, the cases took a dramatic turn after nine years when the Rangers arrested Kamran Farooq, a member of the Sindh Assembly belonging to the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, who was absconding in several cases pertaining to May 12, on Dec 16, 2016.,Farooq, who was booked in two cases for allegedly carrying grenades and unlicensed weapons, had recorded his confessional statement before a judicial magistrate under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), making startling revelations about the alleged involvement of the MQM leadership in one of the most violent episodes of the country’s history.,In his confessional statement, recorded on Dec 20, the then interned MQM MPA had not only confessed to his involvement in the May 12, 2007 mayhem but also implicated party leader Dr Farooq Sattar.,According to his statement, a copy of which is available with ,, suspect Farooq stated that he joined the MQM in 2000 and worked as the party’s “unit and sector in-charge”.,He added that he was given a party ticket to contest the 2013 general election on the recommendation of the then chief of the Karachi Tanzeemi Committee, Hammad Siddiqui.,About his involvement in the May 12 events, he told the magistrate that a meeting was held on May 10, 2007 at the party’s Nine Zero headquarters in the presence of Dr Farooq Sattar, Siddiqui and other leaders.,He said that the “party leadership” had asked him and other “sector in-charges” to ensure that lawyers could not reach the Karachi airport to welcome Iftikhar Chaudhry.,He testified that he, along with his armed accomplices, blocked many thoroughfares on May 12 and resorted to firing, leaving many wounded.,While the MQM spokesperson had rejected Farooq’s confessional statement, the Rangers prosecution department insisted that it was still a crucial piece of evidence.,“Two years have passed since Kamran Farooq made his confession, which is crucial evidence legally admissible in court as the same was recorded before a judicial magistrate,” Advocate Sajid Mehboob Sheikh, head of the Rangers prosecution department, told ,.,“However, the police high-ups have failed to use this evidence in all the cases relating to the May 12 incidents till today,” he claimed.,He cited the example of a similar confessional statement recorded by the defunct Peoples Amn Committee’s (PAC) chief Uzair Jan Baloch, who was interrogated in a criminal case, who had made startling disclosures about the involvement of high-profile political figures and police high-ups in various criminal activities.,“Uzair Baloch’s confessional statement is now being used in 62 criminal cases pending against him and others being tried in different antiterrorism courts,” argued the paramilitary force’s special prosecutor, who is defending Rangers' cases in the ATCs.,On the other hand, the judicial sources said all the cases were still pending at the pre-trial stage, as the police had yet to nominate those named by Kamran Farooq in his confessional statement.,Some believed that there was a lack of interest on the part of the provincial prosecution department.,When contacted by ,, former prosecutor general Shahadat Awan, who was responsible for getting the confessional statement of Kamran Farooq, seemed least bothered about the matter.,Awan put the responsibility of having used the confession in the cases on the Rangers, which was not performing role of prosecution in these cases.,The lawyers’ leaders interviewed by , demanded that the law-enforcement agencies as well as the government should ensure that justice was dispensed to the families of the victims and survivors of the May 12 bloodshed and its perpetrators were punished.,The reason behind the May 12, 2007, violence was the thwarted visit of the then deposed chief justice of Pakistan, Iftikhar Chaudhry.,The MQM — then a united and much more powerful entity than it is today — practically controlled the Sindh government and wanted to prevent the judge from reaching a reception arranged in his honour by members of the bar. ,This was being done in order to please the military ruler Gen Pervez Musharraf, the Muttahida’s political patron. ,However, the MQM’s foes in Sindh — principally the PPP and the ANP — wanted to welcome the judge and had arranged rallies to receive him. ,What resulted was an ugly power play.

1461,2018-05-16,"Human rights defenders in Pakistan face digital threats, attacks: Amnesty
","KARACHI: Human rights defenders in Pakistan are under threat from a targeted campaign of digital attacks, which has seen social media accounts hacked and computers and mobile phones infected with spyware, a four-month investigation by Amnesty International revealed. ,In a new report released on Tuesday titled ‘Human Rights Under Surveillance: Digital Threats Against Human Rights Defenders in Pakistan’, the human rights watchdog revealed how attackers were using fake online identities and social media profiles to ensnare Pakistani human rights defenders online and mark them out for surveillance and cybercrime. ,Take a look: ,“We uncovered an elaborate network of attackers who are using sophisticated and sinister methods to target human rights activists. Attackers use cleverly designed fake profiles to lure activists and then attack their electronic devices with spyware, exposing them to surveillance and fraud and even compromising their physical safety,” said Sherif Elsayed-Ali, Director of Global Issues at Amnesty International. ,HR watchdog calls on authorities to carry out investigation to identify perpetrators,The investigation showed how attackers used fake Facebook and Google login pages to trick their victims into revealing their passwords. “It is already extremely dangerous to be a human rights defender in Pakistan and it is alarming to see how attacks on their work are moving online,” he said. ,The report highlighted the case of Diep Saeeda, a prominent civil society activist from Lahore. On December 2, 2017, one of her friends, Raza Mehmood Khan, a peace activist who tried to bring people from India and Pakistan together through activities like letter-writing, was subjected to an enforced disappearance. ,Also read: ,Ms Saeeda began publicly calling for Mr Raza’s release, including petitioning the Lahore High Court. Soon after, she began to receive suspicious messages from people claiming to be concerned about Mr Raza’s well-being, the report found. ,As per Amnesty International’s investigation, a Facebook user who claimed to be an Afghan woman named Sana Halimi — living in Dubai and working for the UN — repeatedly contacted Ms Saeeda via Facebook Messenger, saying that she had information about Mr Raza. The operator of the profile sent her links to files containing malware called StealthAgent which, if opened, would have infected her mobile devices. ,The profile — which the human rights watchdog believed was fake — was also used to trick Ms Saeeda into divulging her email address, to which she started receiving emails infected with a Windows spyware commonly known as Crimson. ,Amnesty found that several human rights activists in Pakistan have been targeted in this way, sometimes by people claiming to be human rights activists themselves. ,Ms Saeeda also received emails claiming to be from staff of the Punjab chief minister. The emails included false details of a supposed upcoming meeting between the provincial ministry of education and her organisation, the Institute for Peace and Secular Studies. In other cases, the attackers pretended to be students looking for guidance and tuition from Ms Saeeda. ,“Every time I open an email I am now scared. It’s getting so bad I am actually not able to carry out my work — my social work is suffering,” she told Amnesty. ,Amnesty International’s Technology and Human Rights team was able to trace these attacks to a group of individuals based in Pakistan. The report revealed the network of individuals and companies behind the creation of some of the tools seen in surveillance operations used to target individuals in the country. ,Over the past few months, it added, Amnesty had noted with alarm that activists were being subjected to threats, intimidation, violent attacks and enforced disappearances. They included journalists, bloggers, peaceful protesters and other mainstays of civil society. ,“As an elected member of the UN Human Rights Council, Pakistan has a responsibility to uphold the highest international standards. It has repeatedly vowed to protect human rights activists and criminalise enforced disappearances, but what we are seeing shows they have done nothing on this front while the situation is getting worse,” said Sherif Elsayed-Ali. ,“The Pakistani authorities must immediately order an independent and effective investigation into these attacks, and ensure that human rights defenders are protected both online and off,” he added."

1494,2018-05-25,"How Indian forces turned a woman’s wedding into carnage
","			,Tucked into the hills of southern Kashmir’s Anantnag district, Lisser-Czawalgam is no different from any of the other villages that dot the landscape of this picturesque region. A shrine, a graveyard and modestly built houses populate the silent hamlet.  ,It was a cool summer afternoon when we drove into the village and reluctantly knocked at the house of Mubina Gani. A frail, middle-aged lady emerged from a dimly lit corridor and welcomed us in. “You are no different than my own children. Let us talk inside,” she said, showing us to the living room.,Twenty-eight years ago, on May 18, 1990, Mubina, then 25, of nearby Mohripura village, was set to get married. Her hands hennaed, hair scented and wearing an orange-pink dress, she was ready to begin her new life with Abdul Rashid Malik, a farmer by profession.,But, as has happened with infinite others in Indian-controlled Kashmir, Mubina’s dream was snuffed out by personnel of the Border Security Force (BSF).,As armed insurgency raged across the valley, Indian armed forces operated under a carte blanche. Undeclared curfews and checkpoints were a norm. “We had received curfew passes beforehand from the local administration,” said Malik, now in his 50s. He, along with many of his friends and relatives, left by bus at 8:00 in the evening for the wedding in Mohripura. ,After dining and celebrating for a few hours, the procession, along with the bride and few of her relatives, boarded the same bus and left Mohripura and headed back towards Lizzer-Czawalgam. Barely three kilometres into their journey, the vehicle was intercepted by a BSF patrol and ordered to halt. “They first scolded the driver and told him to dim the lights,” recalled Malik. “While my brother tried to show them the curfew pass, they shot the driver.”,What happened afterwards can only be explained as an act of collective punishment, enabled by the systematic legal impunity that the Indian armed forces enjoy in Kashmir. “The BSF personnel indiscriminately opened fire on the bus with a machine gun,” said Mubina. “All of us ducked for cover but couldn’t escape the bullets,” she added. ,Around 10 passengers in the bus were hit, including the newlyweds. The bride and groom sustained seven gunshot wounds in total. Fragments still remain lodged inside their bodies to this day. One of Malik’s cousins, Assadullah Malik, was killed on the spot while five others were critically injured. However, the ordeal was far from over. ,After the guns fell silent, while blood was still oozing from her wounds, Mubina, along with her pregnant aunt, were carried to the nearby fields and gang raped. The bride was raped by at least four BSF personnel. “No one else can comprehend the torture that was inflicted on my body and soul during that night,” Mubina told us, her eyes swelling up. “I spent at least a month recuperating in the hospital.”,All the while, the passengers in the bus lay injured in pools of blood, screaming. But the bride’s nightmare didn’t end there: she was then taken away and kept under detention for at least 48 hours, says Mubina. ,The horrific crime spurred such fear across southern Kashmir that for decades wedding ceremonies were only held in broad daylight. Though a complaint regarding the incident was lodged at a local police station and an official inquiry confirmed that rape had occurred, none of the perpetrators were convicted. “Our statements were recorded multiple times but no one was punished,” Malik said in a resigned tone. ,Systematic legal impunity for the armed forces, even with respect to crimes of a sexual nature, is a norm in Indian-controlled Kashmir. According to a , by the Human Rights Watch, the use of rape as a weapon of war by Indian forces started in the early 1990s as soon as the government adopted a heavy counterinsurgency approach to crush the popular armed rebellion against Indian rule in the region. ,			,The report further adds that despite substantial evidence that Indian army and paramilitary forces were engaged in widespread rape, few of the incidents were ever investigated by the authorities. Out of the miniscule number of investigations that were undertaken, none resulted in a criminal prosecution.,As , as 2009, 17-year-old Asiya Jan and her sister-in-law Neelofar Jan were raped and murdered in Shopian district. While medical evidence established that rape had indeed occurred, the authorities refuted the claims and maintained that their death was the result of drowning in a river whose waters run no more than a few inches deep.,“The unwillingness and lack of investigation in cases of sexual violence committed by armed forces only goes on to show that Kashmiris as a people exist outside the paradigm of what constitutes justice in the Indian legal system, further justifying their demand for freedom from India,” says Irfan Mehraj, a researcher at the Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society, a group that investigates human rights abuses in the region.,Rehabilitation mechanisms to help survivors of sexual abuse cope with psychological trauma also remain undeveloped in Kashmir. Mubina has never been able to procure any specialised help from professional counselors. “At the time of the incident all the injured were provided compensation of 5,000 Indian rupees [74 dollars] each,” Mubina revealed.,In fact, state officials often use compensation as a red herring to quell any demands for impartial investigations into human rights abuses committed by the Indian armed forces.   ,Also, in traditionally conservative societies like Kashmir, survivors of sexual violence are often subject to social stigma. They harbour feelings of worthlessness and shame, as well as post-traumatic stress. “Since the incident occurred, people have never accepted me as an ordinary human being,” Mubina whispered. “Once, during some dispute with one of our neighbours, the latter raked up this ordeal to rebuke me. I felt lifeless.”,Discussions and consequently, social understanding, around sexual crimes remain limited. Linking rape to the loss of ‘honour’ is a pervasive practice. “Rape in Kashmir has been beyond a doubt used as a weapon of war against both women and men,” said Ather Zia, a Kashmiri anthropologist at the University of Colorado. “It will take no less than a revolutionary change in the mindset of people, who themselves are brutalised from daily killings and harassment, to rethink how to rehabilitate the survivors of sexual assault back into the society. We have to create tools to make our own people aware that sexual assault survivors need not suffer again at the hands of society after suffering at the hands of state terrorism for no fault of theirs,” she added.,Until that happens, Mubina and many others like her are bound to suffer the dual violence of the heavily militarised state as well as archaic social structures. “If it wasn’t for the hope of seeing my children succeed through life, I would have died a long time ago,” said Mubina, now a mother of three.    , "

She told us she intended to meet her relatives in Karachi.

1497,2018-05-25,"Japanese women see turning point on sexual harassment after scandal
","			,TOKYO: Japanese women, long accustomed to enduring sexual harassment in silence, are speaking out after a high-profile , stirred debate and protests.,In interviews with Reuters, six prominent women said they hoped Japan was at a turning point in attitudes towards harassment, but urged steps to shrink social, political and economic gender gaps to get at the root causes of the problem.,Administrative Vice Finance Minister Junichi Fukuda resigned in April after accusations that he had sexually harassed a female reporter. Fukuda denied the allegations, and no lawsuits were filed, but the finance ministry later acknowledged the harassment and docked 20 per cent of his pay for six months.,Fukuda could not be reached for comment on this article.,In the month since, harassment has remained a hot-button issue. Internal Affairs Minister Seiko Noda, who holds the portfolio for women’s empowerment in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s cabinet, told Reuters she planned to introduce steps soon to address the problem.,“I think women have put up with sexual harassment thinking it was inevitable while men thought it was OK,” she said.,“In my case ... it was a matter of the power relationship between myself and middle-aged or elderly men drinking until 8 or 9 at night,” said Noda, 57, recalling her experience as a 30-year-old candidate. “Comments like, ‘If you want a vote, let me touch your breasts,’ were a daily occurrence.” ,Public attention to the topic in the wake of the Fukuda scandal, however, is helping change attitudes.,“A #MeToo movement of speaking out has begun,” said opposition lawmaker and former gender equality minister Mizuho Fukushima, referring to the global movement to share accounts of sexual harassment or assault. “What was kept private has become visible.” ,Lawyers, activists and many women who have suffered sexual harassment in Japan say victims have long been reluctant to speak out for fear of being blamed.,That was what freelancer Shiori Ito said happened to her when she went public last year with allegations of rape by well-known journalist Noriyuki Yamaguchi.,Yamaguchi has denied the allegations and was not charged.,In Japan, prosecutors by custom do not explain decisions to the public. A judicial panel rejected Ito’s appeal, saying it had found no grounds to overturn the prosecutors’ decision.,“I have been saying that there was no crime and in fact, there was no crime,” Yamaguchi told Reuters in a telephone interview.,Ito, who worked as an intern for Reuters during the time she says the rape occurred, is seeking compensation from Yamaguchi in a civil suit.,“Talking about rape and sexual harassment is taboo and some people think that if you talk about it ... you will be seen as a tarnished person,” Ito said. She added, though, that things might be changing for the better.,Well-known news anchor Yuko Ando echoed that view, noting that the reaction to the allegation against Fukuda gave her hope.,“Those in Japan who have shut out their memories of sexual harassment are likely to speak out. Because such memories never disappear,” Ando said.,Opposition lawmaker Renho said one challenge was to ensure victims in lower-profile cases are heard and protected.,One of the reporters who accused Fukuda, a top bureaucrat, worked for broadcaster TV Asahi. Neither she nor her employer identified her.,“If it were a female reporter working part-time for a local station or those involved were not in the public eye, I wonder if their voices would be heard,” said Renho, who goes by her first name.,After the TV Asahi reporter told her story of being verbally harassed to a weekly magazine, TV Asahi protested to the finance ministry, which ultimately apologised.,This sort of action is unacceptable since it damages the dignity and human rights of the victim, Deputy Vice Finance Minister Koji Yano told a news conference last month.,TV Asahi demanded that the ministry continue its investigation and that Fukuda apologise in person. The broadcaster told Reuters it had received no further reply from the ministry.,The reporter could not be reached for comment. In a statement issued on her behalf by TV Asahi last month, the reporter, who was not identified, said that she regretted that Fukuda had not admitted to the allegations and added that she hoped it would become easier for victims to take action.,“I pray for a society in which all peoples dignity is respected,” she said in the statement.,Cabinet minister Noda, who plans to challenge Abe for leadership of his ruling party, called for a law to strengthen protection for sexual harassment victims. ,Ultimately, however, resolving the problem requires narrowing social and economic gender inequality, some women said.,“The hotbed of sexual harassment won’t go away unless asymmetry between power held by men and women at the workplace is resolved,” said Chizuko Ueno, director of the non-profit Women’s Action Network and professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo.—Reuters"

","LAHORE: The parents of a Pakistani girl, who , on Friday, are weighing possibilities of getting her custody from the Italian government. ,The parents acted after the Pakistani interior ministry managed to recover the girl from their custody when the Italian embassy took up her case with the local authorities in Islamabad. The matter was reported to police for custody through the Punjab Commission on the Status of Women (PCSW). ,Islamabad handed over the girl to the Italian embassy that arranged her travel back to Italy on Friday. However, police and the PCSW officials categorically denied the Italian embassy’s assertion of her forced abortion in Pakistan. ,“We investigated the case, questioned Farah, her parents and some locals and found no evidence of a forced abortion,” Garhi Shahu Station House Officer (SHO) Qaiser Aziz told Dawn. ,He claimed that even Farah had denied she got an abortion in Pakistan. Her parents were given sufficient time with their daughter at home, police station and in court to convince Farah to change her mind, but to no avail, he said. ,“On Friday, Farah’s parents visited the police station to explore options to get her custody back,” Aziz said, adding that the parents told him that since they were Italian nationals, they reserved the right to seek her custody according to the country’s laws. ,PCSW senior officials also endorsed the police viewpoint. ,“We got details from the family and the girl about her alleged forced abortion in Pakistan but found no evidence,” PCSW legal adviser Imran Qureshi told Dawn. ,Qureshi, who had accompanied police to recover Farah from her parents’ house, said the girl expressed her will to go back to Italy instead of living here. ,“The interior ministry in Islamabad contacted police high-ups through the PCSW almost a week ago seeking help for the recovery of Farah,” Senior Superintendent of Police (Operations) Muntazar Mehdi told Dawn. ,A team of senior police officers, women constables and PCSW officials went to the girl’s residence in Garhi Shahu. ,“We apprised the parents about the girl’s complaints of forced custody,” he claimed, adding that they offered resistance and sought time to convince Farah, but handed her over after she refused to stay. ,Farah was escorted to the police station where she submitted a written statement that she was willing to go back to Italy, Mehdi said. She submitted the same statement to the district and sessions judge later when she was presented in court. ,“She said her parents refused to give back her passport and other travel documents when she told them that she did not want to live with them,” PCSW’s Qureshi quoted Farah as saying. ,The Italian embassy had Farah picked up from the court and taken to Islamabad on May 19, he said. About the travel documents, he said Farah could only manage to get a copy of her passport from her parents. “She flew back to Italy on Friday,” he added. ,Meanwhile, Farah’s parents expressed annoyance over the way the government recovered their daughter, and criticised local laws in such sensitive matters. ,“What the media in Pakistan and Italy did in this case is shameful. They ran photos and stories of my young daughter without our version and discussed her in objectionable words destroying the image of our family,” said Farah’s mother. ,Talking to Dawn, she denied allegations of forced custody and abortion of her daughter, saying Farah was living with them in Pakistan of her own free will. ,“We suggested to police and the representatives of the interior ministry to keep Farah in Darul Aman or any other such place for some time to counsel her,” the mother claimed. “We are leaving for Italy next week to fight the case of Farah’s custody.”"

1503,2018-05-28,"How the Anti-Terrorism Act stole a lifetime from an innocent 16-year-old girl
","It took two decades for Asma Nawab, 37, to walk once again on the sands of Karachi’s Clifton Beach. ,The vast expanse of the Arabian Sea is in many ways an apt representation of endless opportunities — a concept unbeknownst to her ,. ,This was because, for the last 20 years, the only future that Asma could envision was confined to the 8x10 perimeter of her death row cell in Karachi women’s jail., , ,In 1999 an Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) sentenced Asma to death for the murder of her parents and brother. ,Sixteen-year-old Asma’s innocence plea that the murders were committed during a botched robbery was brushed aside by the special court. ,Thereupon, Asma’s quest for justice became entangled in the myriad of delays that define Pakistan’s broken criminal justice. ,It took another nine years for the Sindh High Court to finally decide her appeal in November 2008 with a split decision from the two-member bench. ,The matter was then forwarded to a referee judge, who after another seven years upheld the conviction and death sentence in 2015.,It was not until recently that the faulty investigation propping up Asma’s conviction was finally called into question by the Supreme Court. ,The Court observed that the entire case was built upon weak circumstantial evidence which was collected in blatant violation of mandatory rules of criminal procedure. ,			,As a result, Asma was finally returned the liberty and dignity that was unjustly wrested from her.,The justice system’s cruel response to Asma, a victim of a crime that left her without a family, underscores the urgent need for fundamental reform. ,The first instance of violation occurred when the case was booked by police under the , (ATA). ,Enacted in 1997, the ATA is the Pakistan’s primary anti-terrorism legislation, promulgated to increase the power of law enforcement agencies to prevent and investigate terrorism and to create special ATCs to expedite trials of terrorist suspects.,However, more than two decades following its operation, the law has been largely ineffective in fulfilling its mandate. ,By virtue of a broad and vague definition of terrorism, the law allows for ordinary crimes bearing no nexus to terrorism to be tried under the special regime. ,: ,Section 6 of the law defines terrorism as any crime or threat designed to create a “sense of fear or insecurity in society.” Subsection 2 broadens the scope of the law by listing over 18 crimes that could fall within the meaning of terrorism. ,This includes ordinary crimes already criminalised under the Pakistan Penal Code, such as any crime that  “involves grievous violence against a person or grievous boy injury or harm to person” and “doing of anything that is likely to cause death or endanger a person’s life.”  ,A , by Justice Project Pakistan noted that around 88 percent of those sentenced under the ATA were convicted of non-terrorism crimes. ,Subsequent interviews with police and prosecutors revealed that booking crimes under the ATA was a means to appease politically influential complainant or the general public in high profile cases.,			,United Nations Treaty Bodies have consistently called on the government of Pakistan to ensure that persons convicted for ordinary crimes are not tried under the special procedures of the ATCs. ,However, no measures have been taken thus far. ,The overuse and abuse of the law holds disastrous consequences. Firstly, with a back log of thousands and thousands of cases, the ATCs are riddled with delays which inevitably impact the timely prosecution of actual terrorists.,Similarly, as the law waives key procedural safeguards guaranteed under the ordinary courts and provides enhanced police powers and fast-track investigation and trials, the eventual convictions rest on faulty investigations and severe fundamental rights abuses.  ,Consequently, a significant number of convictions under the ATA are overturned by the superior court in appeal. ,But the rectification of injustices, such as in the case of Asma, comes after suspects have effectively served entire life sentences.,: ,It was in this vein that the Supreme Court in August, 2017 cautioned lower courts against including ordinary crimes like murder within the ambit of the ATA. ,Justice Dost Muhammad Khan in his judgment , that “the courts of law shall not lightly ignore that being a harsh law enacted to punish terrorist or hardcore militant, the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997 will not be extended liberally to cover criminals who commit the crime of murder or attempted murder for any reason or motive that has no connection with terrorism or militancy.” ,However, no demonstrable change has been seen in the jurisprudence of the lower courts. ,Public discourse in Pakistan, in the wake of the few heinous crimes that manage to make their way into headlines,  inevitably demands booking suspects under the ATA for speedy justice. ,What’s missing from the narrative are the countless victims, like Asma, who pay the price for the temporary assuaging of public outrage.  ,: ,In addition to falling victim to Pakistan’s anti-terrorism regime, Asma's identity as a woman also made her susceptible to the violations of justice that she inevitably fell victim to. ,Interventions on access to justice for women in Pakistan remain inordinately focused on victims of crime. Missing from the debate are women who are accused of committing crimes, especially under the ATA. ,Owing to stigma attached to crime, women accused of criminal activity are more likely to be abandoned by family or support networks. ,As a result, they are less likely to have access to effective legal representation during the course of trials and appeals. ,This leads to gross miscarriages of justice, particularly under the parallel regime of expedited trials and investigation under the ATA. ,: ,Additionally, women are also vulnerable to torture and abuse by law enforcement during interrogation and investigation. ,This likelihood quadruples under the ATA, as the special law, under ,, allows for the admission of confessions and statements awarded in police custody as evidence. ,This is in contravention to Pakistan’s evidence law under the Qanun Shahadat Order that only permits confession recorded in the presence of a magistrate to be admissible as evidence. ,As a result, police under the ATA routinely extract confessions from suspects on the basis of torture. The risk of torture is additionally heightened by the police powers to detain a person for up to 30 days without review or the possibility of , petition, and another 90 days through application to the courts. ,These powers facilitate the police’s extraction of coerced confessions and statements from accused parties and witnesses.  ,The UN Committee Against Torture in its , of the government of Pakistan’s initial report in March, 2017 asked the government to ensure that all persons tried under the ATA “have access to legal safeguards against torture, including prompt presentation before a magistrate and the possibility of a , petition, and to ensure that confessions obtained outside the presence of a magistrate are inadmissible as evidence.”,It is evident that Pakistan’s criminal justice has failed to protect women like Asma from abuses of power and misconduct by police. ,			,These instances of severe fundamental rights violations are far from isolated and represent the reality for the majority of Pakistan’s prison population. ,It is critical that the government of Pakistan reform its laws to reduce the definition of terrorism under the ATA through restrictive language and by explicitly excluding common crimes such as murder or hurt from its scope. ,It is also necessary that provisions giving overarching powers of interrogation and investigation to the police, such as section 21H, are excluded from the law to avoid gross miscarriages of justice. ,Only once these reforms are initiated can cases like Asma's be avoided. , "
